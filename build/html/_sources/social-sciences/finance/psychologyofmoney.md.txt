## The Psychology of Money
*by Morgan Housel*

### Main Points

Another fluff book, very anecdotal. Of course, this time, and unlike The Little Book of Common-Sense Investing, the author acknowledges it. I'll just compile the main points in a set:

1. Finance --- spending habits, valuations, risk-reward calculations, and so on --- is mostly an environment-influenced thing. Not just the current environment either; the environments people grew up in will continue to affect their financial decisions. People who grew up in high-inflation environments, slums, and misery will *obviously* spend (and understand) money differently than those who didn't. No one is 'crazy' with their moneyÂ --- they just know, or fear, something you don't.
2. Luck --- and its flip-end risk --- is an unacknowledged, and yet major, factor in determining financial success. People ignore luck because attributing someones' financial success to luck, as opposed to hard-work or talent, is rude and jealous behavior. The successful, however, do not shy away from admitting the influence of this wildcard in their success. For instance: Bill Gates was one of the few high school students to have access to a computer at school, and he acknowledged the role of this computer, and the luck in his access to it. The flip-end of luck, risk, also plays a major part in determining failure. If not ignorance, why else would we laud Zuckerberg for turning down a Yahoo! acquisition offer for Facebook, then turn around and criticize Yahoo! for turning down a Microsoft acquisiting offer? Therefore:
    1. Be careful in who you praise and admire, and who you look down upon and disdain. It is impossible to quantify the role luck and risk had in their success and failure.
    2. Focus less on individuals and case studies, and more on broad patterns.
3. A famous anecdote goes: Joseph Heller (author of Catch-22) was at a billionaires' party. Kurt Vonnegut, also in attendance, informed him that the host earns more in a day than Joseph earned from the sales of Catch-22. Joseph's reponse? "Yes, but I have something he'll never have: enough". There are a million stories of millionaires and billionaires who lost all they had, because they kept dreaming for more. The root cause is envy --- even the richest man in the world probably envies somebody, and he might even bet all his wealth on overtaking that somebody. Hell, you could say that wealth is a selection process that amplifies this trait.
    1. The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.
    2. Social comparison is the root of all ills in this regard.
    3. Enough is not too little.
    4. There are many things not worth risking, no matter the potential gains.
 4. *Generic chapter on compounding*
 5. The Wall Street crash of '29 was disastrous for many peoples' livelihoods. There are stories aplenty of people committing suicide in the aftermath, even millionaires. However, there were also a lucky few that made boatloads of money by shorting the market. What did the former group lack that the latter had? Paranoia and humility. After all, making money is easy --- keeping it is the hard part.
    1. Rather than quantity of money, what you should desire is security of money. A $1 billion that may be lost on a random day, with the roll of a dice, or a $100 million that will never be lost no matter what?
    2. Planning is important, even though plans almost always fail. Incorporate the failure of plans --- hedge your risks, play both sides, secure an exit strategy --- and you will be near unbeatable.
