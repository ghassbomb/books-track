    "content": "Economics is a deeply contradictory field. At any given moment, you can find two experts arguing the opposite assertions. As an entire science, economics is difficult enough as is. But since money so deeply involves itself in our lives, and thus beholds itself to greed, economics is also hostage to ‘special interests’. Certain economic policies which would benefit one interest group are often not the problem–the problem occurs when these policies also negatively affect another interest group. These turn a science into a political playground. Another problem is that economics is a considerably long-term science. Humans, however, are more concerned with their immediate life than the consequences of their short-termism on the next generation. This leads us into the ‘fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences’ of economic policies. These policies may benefit us in the short-term, but they will negatively affect us later on. Politics plays in this: championing immediately beneficial policies wins one considerable popularity, regardless of long-term consequences to a nation. Most of the economic fallacies that harm us so much are the result of ignoring the aforementioned lesson: ‘The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy’ as Henry phrases it.

    "content": "Henry illustrates his principle with Bastiat’s broken-window: A young hoodlum takes a brick through the window of a bakers’ shop. A crowd gathers arounds the now broken window. ‘This is certainly a tragedy’, they think, but the money needed to repair the window–$250 or so–will now be spent into the ‘economy’. It will go to the glazier, who will repair the window, and will spend the money on some other good or service himself, the whole process repeating ad infinitum, and resulting in net benefit for the town. But that’s not the whole story, as Henry reminds us. They are right that the glazier will accrue some business. But the crowd forgot one other actor in this play: the tailor. Was not the baker intending to use that money–that he will now spend on the glazier–on something else? Perhaps, he wanted a new suit, but now he will have to repair a window instead. So, the glazier’s gain of business, in short, is merely the tailor’s loss of business. And so it is for all profit–it comes at someone’s loss of money. ",

Broken homes, bombed factories, accumulated demand, all the things that people wanted and needed, would fuel a reconstruction unparalleled, economists gleefully thought. You can probably put the example given in the last chapter to use here already–if we refer back to the broken window, we figure that every cent used to buy essential goods and services was one less cent gone to luxury goods and services. But another problem is that this assertion confuses need with demand. Just because you need a house doesn’t mean you will buy a house–because you just may not have the purchasing power to buy a house. But a postwar ‘boom’ did occur, no? People had more money after the war, sure, but this money was worth less thanks to wartime inflation.

    "content": "When providing employment becomes the end, need becomes a subordinate consideration. Projects have to be invented. Instead of thinking only of where bridges must be built, the government spenders begin to ask themselves where bridges can be built. Government spending is often seen as a one-size-fits-all cure for all economic illness. The spendthrifts ignore a simple fact: everything we get must be paid for in some way. This is not a law of capitalism or democracy–it’s a rule of nature. The accumulation of debt to aid government spending is not simply forgotten–often, the average citizen ends up paying all that debt off via inflationary costs, or just plain increases in tax. Henry presents it in a simple way: ‘either immediately or ultimately every dollar of government spending must be raised through a dollar of taxation’. Of course, Henry warns us off of thinking government spending is a complete evil. There is a certain amount and use of spending that is necessary–for our infrastructure, and public services. So how do we determine if a certain use of spending is worth it? . Henry gives us a simple metric: ‘[if the public work/service] is even more necessary to the taxpayers collectively than the things for which they would have individually spent their money if it had not been taxed away from them, there can be no objection [to the money’s use]’. When presented with this line of thought, a common counter-argument concerns the benefit of the employment generated in supplying and building that public work. As Henry astutely observes, ‘the implication is that these are jobs that would not otherwise have come into existence’. But if you go back to Bastiat’s broken window, you will notice that this is fallacious thought! That money would have been spent regardless by the taxpayers who funded this project. But again, the bridge created with our money is visible and so are the construction workers that build it–the jobs created by our grocery spending are not! . ",

But taxes have a secondary, psychological, effect. A company that spends so much on taxes that it can’t expand not only doesn’t expand, but it also discourages others from starting business in the first place. A person who loses half his wealth to taxes wonders why he spends as much time working for the government as he does for himself and his family.

Private credit exists, so why are these farmers and businessmen and whomever else government credit hopes to benefit not going to these private dealers? Well, the answer is they are. But the distinction between government and private credit is this: the private lender examines the risks of his investments closely–he checks backgrounds, the character of the person he’s lending to, his credit score. After all, if he makes a bad investment it would not just damage his finances, but dent his reputation. The same is not true of the government, and in fact must not be true. If the government judiciously checked everyone it was lending to, then why would we even need government credit? This would be no different from how private lenders credit, after all. So we’re handing out cash to suspect individuals, but that’s not the only problem with this arrangement. The other thing is that supply–of both capital and the goods/services/land it is being used to purchase–is limited. So when the government lends capital to person A, a perhaps irresponsible or, at worst, reprehensible person, whom the private lenders wouldn’t deal with, they deprive person B. Regardless of if person B has been judicious and fiscally responsible, they deprive him of the same facilities, or at least make him pay more (whether in credit or his own cash) for the facilities.

    "title": "Spread-the-Work Schemes",
    "content": "The previous chapter touches on the historical consequences upon machinery because of the belief that the more efficient way of doing things decreases employment. This fallacy is believed because there is a deeply held belief that there is a fixed amount of work in this world. It is impossible to increase the amount of work in this world–therefore we must divide it amongst the people more. This fallacious belief has led to the conception of a number of ‘spread-the-work’ schemes. One of these is the minute subdivision of labor. By ensuring that the carpenter does not deal in any stone–only the stonemason does, and vice versa–we ensure sufficient employment for both. However, if we go back to Bastiat’s illustration (for the nth time), we realise that the homeowner who has to employ both for work on his house will spend that much less money on other amenities. Another faulty scheme conceived is the idea of shortening the work week. This scheme comes in two flavours: . | Reducing the work week, but nothing more. | Reducing the work week and increasing hourly pay (to compensate for lost hours). | . The first flavour can be struck down quite easily. It definitely increases employment, but has no other (positive) effect. If we are optimistic, it leads to no negative effects either, but only if we are optimistic. This is because it simply leads to the reallocation of work–work is taken from the employed worker and given to the unemployed worker. This seems good, but without an allied pay increase, it functions as a ‘work’ redistribution. Only, the goal of a wealth redistribution is from the rich to the poor–not the working-class to the non-working class as in this example. The second flavour is not much tougher to destroy, and actually much more disastrous in effect. If we increase pay to compensate for lost hours, the costs of production will increase. The consequences of this are obvious: the smaller and less efficient businesses (marginal producers who don’t benefit from economies of scale) will be put out of business by the larger corporations. In sum total, jobs will actually be lost. ",

It is the connivance of merchants to say otherwise. Local manufacturers have an advantage regardless of tariff or tax and if they are still unsuccessful as compared to international competitors, it would be better perhaps for them to pivot to other industries than let the people suffer the increased costs of goods from their rent-seeking. Assuming a particular industry has a disadvantage compared to international competitors, the withdrawal of the tariff protecting its advantage would mean the end of the industry and the unemployment of all those involved. If we consider the long-view, however, we notice that consumers will save more money on the purchase of the goods that were tariffed, and thus will have more money to spend on other goods, including those that are domestically produced.

    "title": "Chapter XII - The Drive for Exports",
    "content": "This is, as John Stuart Mill so clearly pointed out, that the real gain of foreign trade to any country lies not in its exports but in its imports. Its consumers are either able to get from abroad commodities at a lower price than they could obtain them for at home, or commodities that they could not get from domestic producers at all. Exports pay for imports and vice versa. When an American exporter sells his goods to a British importer, he is not paid in the currency he uses everyday–the $–but the British pound. In order to gain some utility out of this foreign currency, he has two options: . | Buy British exports with said pounds. | Sell these pounds for dollars to somebody else, who will likely use them to buy British exports. | . And vice versa. What happens here is that the ‘the dollar debts of foreigners’ (imports from countries that use the $) are cancelled out by ‘their dollar credits’ (exports to countries that use the $). Granted, this was not always true. Sometime (before Bretton Woods), when dollar debts (or whatever else) were not in fact cancelled out for some reason or the other, gold was used to make up the difference. The reason for using gold, instead of just exporting commodities, is because gold, as an international currency at the time, had no obstacles to being imported (tariffs, etc.) and was thus an efficient way of settling debts. There are a couple common fallacies when it comes to foreign trade. The first suggests that if a nation–say, America–were to loan out its currency–the $–to another nation, the foreign exchange would be used to pay for American goods. Thus, even if the loans were not repaid, ‘America’ would still benefit because of the increase in exports. This is partially true, but misleading–if a British person were to buy an American good and pay for it with loaned American money that they have no intention to repay later, that’s simply free stuff for them! It would benefit the exporters that made the good, but it would harm whomever loaned the importer the money–if a private lender, then it would occur in their losses, and if the government loaned the money, then the burden would fall upon taxpayers. Export subsidies function the same–by subsidising goods for export, we are artificially making them cheaper than they cost us to make, for foreigners to buy. Export businesses benefit greatly, and so does the foreigner, but everybody else loses. ",

    "title": "Parity Prices",
    "content": "Henry presents a general history of the idea of ‘parity prices’ (also known as the Doctrine of Parity). The parity price argument essentially argues that: . | National prosperity is linked to the prosperity of farmers | If a farmer lacks the purchasing power to buy the products of industry, industry languishes and depression lay on the horizon | . To prevent depression, it is necessary to link, or ensure parity between, the prices of industry-produced goods and the prices of farm-produced good. This will ensure that the farmer has enough purchasing power to spend on industry-produced goods, and thus ensure employment for city-workers. There are many problems with this argument. Firstly, why limit the argument to just agricultural products? I’ll tell you why: because agricultural products do not increase or deplete in quality over-time as industrial goods do. The argument would seem farcical if this was taken into account in examples, so it’s not. And what about the method utilised to ensure the parity? Obviously, it must be enforced by the government through either: . | A simple, enforced edict (price controls) | The government can purchase all agricultural products at the parity price itself | The government can lend the farmers money while they withhold crops from the market, decreasing supply and thus increasing price, until parity price is reached | . If any of these methods, or a combination of them is used, farmers will indeed get a higher-price for their goods. But the purchaser of agricultural products will lose their purchasing power in exchange–a reallocation of wealth. The whole scheme also means a destruction in supply to ensure high-prices, meaning less agricultural goods on the market. This would be a net loss to a country, and even the farmer would not benefit much if we take this into account. Because, while he does get more per, say, bushel of wheat sold, he sells less bushels of wheat in total–basically cancelling the benefit out. ",

    "content": "When Robinson Crusoe found himself on a deserted island, he had a lot of needs (shelter, food, water, warmth). As a single person, he could only focus on one of these at a time, however. And, once done with one problem, he must move onto the next most pressing. If a family were stranded, then they would certainly have more leeway. They could assign tasks–the specialisation and division of labor. For example, the father was done gathering enough firewood, he wouldn’t gather more than they needed. He’d help find food instead. If he continued gathering firewood, it would be at the expense of food. It is similar on a macro level. The prices of goods are determined by their supply and demand. You wouldn’t keep making firewood if there was no more demand for it. If you did, nobody would buy it, or they would get it for free. Price is partly determined by costs of production, yes, but that is the base–consider the demand/supply the filling. A common misconception–by a group Henry calls the ‘production-for-use’ school–is that, once the free market system/capitalists can not make money on a product, they will stop manufacturing it, thus leading to scarcity and harming many people. The problem in this argument is that if there were in fact such demand for said good, no manufacturer would stop producing it in the first place! . Another fault in the argument is that most of these manufacturers do not simply stop making goods. Usually, they pivot to making other goods. For example, car manufacturers some time from now may entirely pivot to EVs. This will not lead to scarcity as they will only pivot when demand for non-electric cars is (rightly) eradicated, and neither will it lead to a loss of production as the manufacturer now produces electric cars instead.

    "title": "Government Price-Fixing",
    "content": "Price controls are a handy political tool for politicians, and a business opportunity for bureaucrats. They are often used in tandem with a blame game putting higher prices of goods on the greed of businessmen, thus diverting responsibility from officeholders. The argument goes thus: if the government does not intervene, the price for a certain good will inflate so much as to be unaffordable for the poor. By intervening to decrease the price of a good, the government ensures two things: . | Increase in demand for that good | Reduce supply for that good (because profit margins are reduced, or sometimes are deficits instead, less incentive to produce the good) | . And there: we have a shortage of said good! The government at this point can either backtrack or double-down. For the latter, they have four choices: rationing, cost-control, subsidies and universal price-fixing. The first option is an extension of the blame game–before, blame was being put on rich producers for greedily inflating prices, now blame is put on rich consumers for greedily taking more than their fair share. Rationing usually involves everyone (equally) getting limited amounts of certain coupons–a double price system–that they can redeem for said good. Thus, everyone is deprived. The second option is like playing whack-a-mole. Problems arising from price fixing a certain good are ‘solved’ by price-fixing another good that is used to manufacture our initial good, and so on and on forever. Eventually, we arrive at universal price fixing anyways. Subsidies make a little more sense: the government is buying goods from their manufacturers for market price and then selling it to people at a certain rate, usually less than it bought the goods for. The problem is this: the goods are subsidized for the rich as well (unless they are rationed). If the government forcibly intervenes to lower the price of a commodity, then the rich are actually who’ll purchase it the most and, thus, will utilize the subsidy the most. ",

    "title": "What Rent Control Does",
    "content": "Rent control is oft imposed because the supply of housing is inelastic–it can not be immediately increased as supply demands. If in a war, for example, housing may be destroyed by bombs. Since production can’t be ramped up in even a normal economy–war economies divert resources to war production–the price of housing would skyrocket. Thus, rent control is argued to be necessary, at least until the construction industry gets its gears running. There is already one negative consequence of imposing rent controls: if rent is increased in accord with war inflation and demand, then it is true that tenants would find it harder to rent their homes. However, this would urge them to economise–to take roommates, for example. And, this would not require any new housing. Rent control is also discriminatory. Even if landlords did not raise their prices, and instead allowed tenants to bid for rent, prices would rise just as surely. Rent control essentially subsidises those out of homes that they can actually afford, for those in homes that they can not afford! And the argument that rent control does not affect construction is just plain-false. Construction costs rise in proportion to wartime inflation and the scarcity of resources, but if property builders are also forced to set a low-price for rent, then they will make little-to-no profit margins and be disincentivised from production. Even worse, property owners are not only disincentivised from creating new housing, they are disincentivised from maintaining housing, if they even have the funds to do so! Eventually, as property decays and taxes accrue, not only are landlords not making profits on housing, they are making losses. They can not even sell off their property, because who would buy a loss-making entity in a war economy? They abandon their properties, and whole areas turn to slums. Some cope by removing rent controls on luxury apartments–only, this makes things worse! Property builders are incentivised to build luxury housing, and low-cost housing is now even worse off. City governments go bankrupt for the shrinkage of revenues from property related taxes. The result? The government doubles down, of course! It involves itself in public housing now (please take a rest, Mr. Government, you need it). Obviously, the public housing schemes are paid for by taxpayers and, as with all these farcical schemes, it would have been better in the end to let taxpayers just pay for rent at its actual price instead.

    "content": "A ‘wage’ is a price–the price for labor, to be more specific. If, as we have proven, it is pointless and damaging for the government to regulate prices, then the same holds true for wages. As explained before, this is because the negative consequences far outweigh the positive ones. For instance, when a minimum wage law is passed, it effectively prices out anybody whose work is worth less than the minimum wage. If you’re disabled, for example, then it would be very hard for you to work at or above the minimum wage since you’d be competing with non-disabled people. Thus, most firms will simply refuse to hire you. Before, however, you could’ve made at least some money working somewhere, even if it was a pittance. To make up for your newfound unemployment, the government will have to pay a relief. A relief of around half the minimum wage might be fine if you were making less than that, but if you were making more? Thus, it is necessary to match the minimum wage. But then, if you’re working and earning minimum wage or slightly above, what point is there in working? You could earn the same amount of money idling, after all! . Let’s now look at the consequences upon employers. To make up for increased costs of production, firms will have to increase the prices of their products. Since minimum wage laws only apply nationally, industry loses a good chunk of its competitiveness to international competitors with cheaper labor costs. A real-life example of this is how Western countries lost their industry to China, which offered labor so cheap compared to the West that the costs of production and costs of transport still allowed for products vastly cheaper than locally-manufactured counterparts in Western grocery shelves. Some respond to this with the argument that firms who underpay do not deserve to exist. But this ignorant argument completely throws consumers, and the employees themselves, under the bus. If the firm paid such bad wages, then why did it’s employees not flee to other firms, or even join this firm in the first place? It must have offered something to attract, and keep, the employees. And finally, to the argument that some monopolies can afford to offer below-market wages because they have no other competitors: in order to become a monopoly in the first place, they will have to have offered high-wages initially to price out competitors. If they reversed this policy later, and started paying substandard wages, then this would only mean that the company would stop expanding as skilled labor would cease to be attracted. Therefore, to sustain expansion and attract labor, it would be necessary for the company to maintain high wages. ",

The same consequences as price control. Another problem is this mindsets ignorance of the white collar class–the ones that don’t work manual labor, and pretty much everybody else. Since this class would have to pay for the increased labor costs, investment and enterprise (usually the domain of solely this class) would diminish, and everybody would be worse off in the long-term. To finish, a quote: . If we try to run the economy for the benefit of a single group or class, we shall injure or destroy all groups, including the members of the very class for whose benefit we have been trying to run it. We must run the economy for everybody. ",

The first common misconception has to do with the confusion of price (inflation) with currency (depreciation) or the mistake of confusing wealth with money. The logical conclusion to this confusion is the thought that if the government were to simply issue more money to everyone, we would all be richer! There is a more sophisticated group that argues only limited amounts of money be printed, to make up for ‘gaps’ in purchasing power. And then, there are the actually sane who realise that more money = less purchasing power per unit currency. But they wish for this outcome–more inflation will decrease purchasing power, which will decrease imports and instead increase exports. It will make it easier to pay off debts as the principal and interest alike are worth less, they say. ",

And yet, there are some who argue for people to save less, spend more, and stop ‘sitting on’ wealth. This argument is ignorant. The prudent human is not harming society by withholding money–he has two options with the money: . | He can store it in a savings or commercial bank account | He can invest it. | . If he stores it with a bank, the bank usually lends it to businesses who use the money to expand operations. Otherwise, in option 2, he invests it directly into the aforementioned businesses. Either way, his money produces plenty value for the economy, and really his saving money is akin to spending it. Even better, as his net worth grows continuously both by the means of his investments and the money he saves, he compounds this cycle. He provides more of a benefit to the nation than the man who would squander all his income as soon as he gets it. Granted, straight hoarding cash in your floorboards is harmful to the economy. But that is not ‘saving’, as that cash loses its value constantly due to inflation and thus, there is little incentive for anyone to actually do this except for illegal purposes. ",

I’m not one for a New Years’ Resolution, and this is assuredly not that. It’s more of a general set of goals. Last year, I set 50 books as my GoodReads goal and failed miserably. This time, I’ve tempered my expectations (25 books) and revised my method to get through books quicker. I don’t expect to succeed completely, but if I can get close then I’ll be happy. Most people are setting close to 50 books for their goals, but don’t be fooled: if they do achieve these goals, it’ll mostly be fictional ‘slop’ (your young adult novels, and such), and other light reads. That’s the amount of books, but this year I’d also like to split these 25 books into various genres and topics that I’d like to learn more about. Like I said, if you read light books (I don’t), then you will easily exceed your goals, and if you read heavy books, you’ll fall short. By planning my reads ahead of time, and handpicking each book, I can hopefully achieve my goals with more success. This is more around 30 books, but I plan to carry some reads over to the next year, and the bolded ones are priority. So, here they are (in no particular order): . | Game Theory . | Game Theory: A Nontechnical Introduction | Prisoner’s Dilemma: John von Neumann, Game Theory, and the Puzzle of the Bomb | The Art of Strategy | Theory of Games and Economic Behavior | . | Economics . | Edible Economics | Basic Economics | Capital in the Twenty-First Century | Debt: The First 5,000 Years | The Road to Serfdom | . | Business Strategy . | The McKinsey Way | Playing to Win: How Strategy Really Works | Competitive Strategy | Your Strategy Needs a Strategy | Competitive Advantage | Blue Ocean Strategy | . | Philosophy . | The Prince | Story of Philosophy | Beyond Good and Evil | Man’s Search for Meaning | Plato’s Works | . | Mathematics . | (see: Maths Track) | . | Management . | The Goal | Good to Great | High Output Management | The Effective Executive | Leading Change | . | General Business &amp; Finance . | Principles | The Psychology of Money | The Black Swan | Financial Intelligence | . | Investing . | The Little Book of Common-Sense Investing | The Intelligent Investor | . | Computer Science . | (see: CS Track) | . | .

I mean, who doesn’t want an encyclopaedia for a brain? Problem: my memory is horrible! After a bunch of digging around, messing around, reading (books and articles), I’ve found one method that works for me: detailed note-taking. As I read a book, I summarize the contents of what I’ve read post-chapter, post-subchapter, post-part, etc.; the timing varies depending on the organization of the book. For instance, if the lowest level of a books’ structure is a subchapter, then I will read through the book, one subchapter at a time, and then summarize the contents of that subchapter. I will do this entirely from memory and understanding. Once done, I will run through the subchapter to make sure I got everything right, edit the summary accordingly, and voila! Not only is this an active method for remembering book content, I can also revise these shortened, summarized notes at a later date to make sure they stick. If you paired this routine with an Anki-style spaced repetition programme, you might just become a super-genius. This blog contains these notes. ",

    "content": "We are not only irrational , but predictably irrational–that our irrationality happens the same way, again and again. Whether we are acting as consumers, business-people, or policymakers, understanding how we are predictably irrational provides a starting point for improving our decision-making and changing the way we live for the better. Dan Ariely tells us a story: When he was eighteen, he was the victim of an explosion of ‘a large magnesium flare’. Medical treatments in the aftermath and the ensuing isolation left him with an inquisitive and thoughtful nature–and a boatload of painful remedies. One such remedy was his daily ‘bath’. During this ‘bath’, bandages soaked in disinfectant were removed from his body, and new ones put on. When lacking skin, as he did at the time, this is an excruciating experience. In dealing with the pain, the nurses who removed his bandages were confronted with two options: . | Remove the bandage quickly and immediately, suffering the patient a sharp burst of pain | Remove the bandage slowly, spreading the pain out over a longer period of time, but perhaps increasing the total pain suffered | . This is a familiar dilemma to us all, even if you don’t realize it immediately. The nurses preferred option 1, and reading it initially, I agreed. Dan eventually recovered, but as he advanced his scholarly career, he kept this dilemma in his mind. He later learned that the nurses were wrong, or that ‘they were most likely the victims of inherent biases in their perceptions of their patients pain’ as he put it. The opposite was true, and he had empirically proven it–as a good scientist would. When he pursued this with his (now, former) nurses, by and large most were shocked and changed their ways. Dan’s point in bringing this up is that, if even these extremely experienced nurses didn’t realize their methods were wrong, their behaviors were irrational, then perhaps we often similarly–wrongly–deal with common problems, repeatedly. In Dan’s words, most of our mistakes are predictably irrational, and by understanding the behaviors that lead to them better, we can make less of these mistakes. ",

    "content": "As H. L. Mencken, the twentieth-century journalist, satirist, social critic, cynic, and freethinker noted, a man’s satisfaction with his salary depends on whether he makes more than his wife’s sister’s husband. Why the wife’s sister’s husband? Because this is a comparison that is salient and readily available. Our decisions are typically informed not by absolute values, but by comparison with other items. This is especially true when, say, we’re purchasing an item about which we’re not experts on–we look for the closest item about which we are reasonably well-informed about, and base our purchase on that. Dan gives us an interesting example: he read three offers on The Economist’s website once that piqued his interest: a $59 internet-only subscription; a $125 print-only subscription; and a $125 print AND internet subscription. He quizzed his students on which plan they would pick: 16 chose the first; 0 chose the second; and 84 chose the final option. This makes some sense: who would pick the print-only subscription when the print and internet subscription is the exact same cost? But is there any specific rationale for why more students selected the last option than the first? . To figure this out, Dan ran another test: . | a $59 internet-only subscription | a $125 print AND internet subscription | . If you thought the results would be similar, you’d be wrong! 68 students selected the first option, and only 32 chose the second. Why is this? . Well that’s because, as Dan puts it, ‘we not only tend to compare things with one another but also tend to focus on comparing things that are easily comparable–and avoid comparing things that cannot be compared easily’. Basically, given three options, two of which are similar but of which one is visibly better, we would select the one that is better, disregarding the third option entirely! For example, if you have three choices: A, B, and B’–where B is a better version of B’, and A is completely distinct from the two–you are more likely to pick B! . This has immediate psychological importance for which Dan offers an interesting example: . in 1993, federal securities regulators forced companies, for the first time, to reveal details about the pay and perks of their top executives. The idea was that once pay was in the open, boards would be reluctant to give executives outrageous salaries and benefits. […] But guess what happened. Once salaries became public information, the media regularly ran special stories ranking CEOs by pay. Rather than suppressing the executive perks, the publicity had CEOs in America comparing their pay with that of everyone else. In response, executives’ salaries skyrocketed. […] Now the average CEO makes about 369 times as much as the average worker–about three times the salary before executive compensation went public. ",

    "content": "Or, as Mark Twain once noted about Tom Sawyer, “Tom had discovered a great law of human action, namely, that in order to make a man covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain.” . James Assael was once a supplier of waterproof watches to the US war-effort but as the war died down he couldn’t find a new market for his watches. The Japanese had a market, but they didn’t have the money, only pearls. Assael took the deal and decided to trade his watches for pearls, and soon became known as ‘the Pearl king’. A while later, he was approached by a Frenchman one day who had a massive supply of ‘black pearls’. There was no market for these black pearls, however. Assael tried to market them simply, but these efforts failed. If he couldn’t tap into old markets, Assael decided to create his own market, and this market would be willing to pay extortionist amounts for these–previously worthless–pearls. He went to a prominent gemstone dealer friend of his and had him display the pearls in the window of his store for exorbitant prices, alongside his other gems. Parallel to that, he also ran an advertisement campaign marketing the black pearls alongside the most expensive of jewelry. Soon, the overpriced black pearls were selling like hotcakes. Assael had taken something essentially unseen before–and therefore worthless–and made it a literal gem. How? He associated this item with gems–this initial comparison the consumers were led to was imprinted onto their minds, and informed their later assumptions of its price. They had never seen a black pearl or its price before, but if you were to ask them its price after they saw these adverts, it would be outrageously expensive. Dan calls this ‘anchoring’ or ‘imprinting’; when we buy a product at a certain price, we become ‘anchored’ to that price. In an experiment, he had his students associate the last two digits of their social security number with an assortment of items, and then asked them to bid on these items; he discovered that the people with the largest last-two-digits paid, on average, a higher price for each item than the students with the smaller last-two-digits. These last-two-digits became an ‘anchor’. This is ‘arbitrary coherence’; initial prices are arbitrary, but they shape our perception of later prices. Price-tags alone are not anchors, however. They are associated, ‘imprinted’, when we contemplate buying a product at that price-tag. Only then do we resort to these comparisons. And anchors are not forever; we gradually change our anchors as we are exposed to change. If gasoline prices are hiked–changed from our anchor–we complain and maybe drive a little less for the first few months, but eventually we get used to the price and return to our pre-hike level of gasoline use. In so doing, our anchor changes to the new post-hike price. This leads into herding; when you see many people doing a certain thing, you are more inclined to do that thing yourself. This is behavior herding. Self-herding, however, is when you do something for the first time, like going to Starbucks, and the next time you walk past a Starbucks you think “I went there once before, so going again is a good decision”; you are herding, but instead of herding behind other peoples’ decisions, you are herding behind your own past decisions, your anchors. This becomes a cycle, and soon, as they say, ‘old habits die hard’. Another question is, why Starbucks? If the coffee was cheaper, for example, at your previous choice of coffee store, why did we change to Starbucks? Why did this ‘anchor’ at our previous coffee shop not influence our decision this time? The answer is that, by brooking comparisons to other coffee shops and making Starbucks as distinct from them as possible, Howard Shultz (Starbucks’ founder) prevented potential customers from using other coffee shops as anchors for Starbucks.

    "content": "Zero is not just another discount. Zero is a different place. The difference between two cents and one cent is small. But the difference between one cent and zero is huge! . It’s time for another experiment. Dan sets up a table at a large public building with two offerings: Hershey’s Kisses (henceforth abbreviated HK) and a Lindt truffle. A Lindt truffle, for reference, costs about 30 cents. He offers the Lindt for 15 cents, and the HK for 1 cent. As customers see the table, they make a simple cost-benefit analysis and realize that the truffle is of superior quality and comparatively better than the HK, and 73% of them choose it! . Dan now cuts off one-cent from the prices of both. The HK is offered for free, and the Lindt for 14 cents. The fundamental dynamics here haven’t changed, and the Lindt is still the better choice, right? You’re right, but the customers thought differently! 69% selected the HK this time, compared to 31% for the truffle! . Zero is not just another price; zero can lead us into trouble. There’s nothing wrong with grabbing free items; the problem is when two-for-one deals, offers between a free and non-free item, and other dilemmas come to. When deciding between a free and non-free item, we do not consider the free item as 0, but merely as free. We forego traditional cost-benefit analysis in so doing! . Time also figures in this issue. Free items often have an added time cost: you’re usually not the only one pumped to get in line for a free serving of ice cream! . ",

    "content": "Dan organizes another experiment. This time: he requests three groups of students to accomplish the same task. They have to drag (digital) circles into squares, as many as they can, within a time limit of five minutes. One group gets paid $5 for participation, one group gets paid 50c, and the last group doesn’t get paid at all. The group that got paid $5 dragged (on avg) 159 circles, and the ones who received 50c dragged 101 circles on avg. The ones who didn’t get paid? They dragged 168, more than either! Why is this? . According to Dan, we have two ‘norms’ we interact according to: social norms, and market norms. Social norms are friendly requests, and involve our communitarian and social nature. Market norms, on the other hand, are determined by sheer mathematics: cost-benefit analyses, and the like. So the reason the $5 group outperformed the 50c group is, as per market norms, simply because they were being paid less and were thus less motivated to do work. The reason for the last group working harder than the $5 group is simply this: there are some things ‘money can’t buy’, and the motivation created by our social norms (shown in volunteer work, charity, etc.) is one of those things. An interesting thing to note is when exactly we apply either norm. According to Dan, the moment money is even mentioned in work or requests, our social norms evaporate and our market norms take hold. Having these two parallel ethics within us is fine while they’re separated (the mythical ‘work-life balance’ among others), but sometimes they intersect with harmful consequences. Dan gives a good example: . A guy takes a girl out for dinner and a movie, and he pays the bills. They go out again, and he pays the bills once more. They go out a third time, and he’s still springing for the meal and the entertainment. At this point, he’s hoping for at least a passionate kiss at the front door. His wallet is getting perilously thin, but worse is what’s going on in his head: he’s having trouble reconciling the social norm (courtship) with the market norm (money for sex). On the fourth date, he casually mentions how much this romance is costing him. Now he’s crossed the line. Violation! She calls him a beast and storms off. He should have known that one can’t mix social and market norms–especially in this case–without implying that the lady is a tramp. He should also have remembered the immortal words of Woody Allen: “The most expensive sex is free sex.” . One way to circumvent the evaporation of social norms, but still compensate whomever you’re involving, is to offer them gifts instead. Gifts, as opposed to hard cash, still figure in our social norms. Hearing of gifts does not move us into market norm-mode. Repeating the experiment, but instead with (differently priced) chocolates instead of money, Dan found that pretty much all groups performed the same; as in, they all worked with social norms in mind. There are advantages to market norms, however. As per Dan: ‘market norms are not just about effort–they relate to a broad range of behaviors, including self-reliance, helping, and individualism.’ For example, a group of researchers gave two groups of participants puzzles with themes: one theme involved money, while the other theme was ‘neutral’. The participants attempting to solve the puzzles related to money worked far longer before asking for help than the ones with the neutral themes. However, you have to be careful in breaking social norms in favor of market ones. Dan gives an example: a daycare in Israel considered imposing a fine on parents late to pick their children up. The problem? Originally, parents and daycare workers were operating on social norms, and thus parents would feel a good dose of guilt on being late, perhaps changing their behavior. After introducing the market norm (fee), the parents actually started being more tardy, because ‘they could decide for themselves whether to be late or not’ and felt no guilt (after all, they were compensating them!). That’s not all, though. The daycare center reversed the policy, but it resulted in a further increase of tardy pickups. After all, now there were no market or social norms in place. What does this tell us? It takes a long while for social norms to recover after being replaced. ",

    "content": "Dan continues on the topic of market norms. His experiment this time involves Starburst Fruit Chews. His hypothesis is this: if he displays a limited number of fruit chews for the price of 1c, more Starbursts will be sold (per person) than if he sold the Starbursts for free. As you’ve probably figured out by now, his hypothesis rang true. ‘When the Starbursts cost a cent apiece, the average number of candies per customer was 3.5, but when the price went down to zero, the average went down to 1.1 per customer.’. This contradicts two laws of demand: . | When the price of a product goes down, its market increases because more people can afford it | This market may also buy more than one of said product, further increasing its demand | . The first law rings true: in real numbers, more Starbursts were given away than bought. But the second law is disproven. This is, of course, because our social norms take over when we see the ‘gift’ Starbursts, and we think ‘I shouldn’t take too many because other people will also want some’. Dan gives us another interesting example: he recently went to a sushi restaurant with his friends. At the end of their meal, there was one tuna left, but neither he nor his friends had the courage to take it for themselves. When the waitress came to take it away, he asked her if this was common: . “Oh,” she said, “I find one extra piece left almost every time. I think it is even more common than people finishing all their sushi.” . Dan explores further. What about effort? If you were asked to work for a limited amount of Starbursts, maybe solve a number of puzzles, how many would you attempt and how many Starbursts would you take? Dan tried out the experiment with Lindt truffles this time. He had an assistant offer people the truffles for: . | 1 cent each | Free-of-cost | for however many e’s (literally, the letter) in a stack of pages they found, they could take a truffle (if they wanted) | . The first group took an average of 30 truffles each, the second took 1.5, and the final group took 8.6; in-between, but closer to the second group. ",

    "content": "Dan veers into controversial territory in his next experiment. He decides to experiment on how much peoples’ attitudes change when in ‘emotionally heightened’ states, as compared to their attitudes in normal, impassioned situations. His emotion of choice was sexual arousal. How would sexual arousal affect peoples’ decision-making skills? The experiment was open only to men. Dan sent out ads and soon had–quite a few–willing participants. The experiment was of two parts: on the first day, the participant would be interviewed and then would have to answer a set of questions. These would be his normal, impassioned attitudes. The same participant would come back a few days later and be set up in a darkened room. He would be provided ‘material’ and, at the same time as he ‘utilized’ this material, he would have to answer the same set of questions. These would be his attitudes in his emotionally heightened state. The results were about as one would expect: . Across the 19 questions about sexual preferences, when Roy and all the other participants were aroused they predicted that their desire to engage in a variety of somewhat odd sexual activities would be nearly twice as high as (72 percent higher than) they had predicted when they were cold. […] In the five questions about their propensity to engage in immoral activities, when they were aroused they predicted their propensity to be more than twice as high as (136 percent higher than) they had predicted in the cold state. Similarly, in the set of questions about using condoms, and despite the warnings that had been hammered into them over the years about the importance of condoms, they were 25 percent more likely in the aroused state than in the cold state to predict that they would forego condoms. This idea of a janus faced man–publicly respectable, privately passionate–has captivated many a human and is the basis of much literature. Our participants were perfectly rational and intelligent people, but all this evaporated in their passion. What lessons can we learn from this? For starters, never assume that your passionate brain, your animalistic side, will do anything rational. While sane, take all precautions you would need. ",

    "content": "Giving up on our long-term goals for immediate gratification, my friends, is procrastination. Dan turns his sights to procrastination, everybody’s biggest problem. The lack of self-control can be harmful both on an individual level and a larger scale. Dan notes that, before 2008, America had a negative savings rate, meaning that people were spending more money than they had. There are two reasons for this: easy access to credit and rampant consumerism. Ultimately, this consumptive contributed to the 2008 recession (Dan doesn’t mention it in the book). Procrastination is similar to the phenomenon we observed in the last chapter, both stemming from the same underlying issue of humans as animals lacking self-control in certain moments. People often make ambitious promises to themselves but, in the moment, they tend to forget those commitments and postpone tasks. As a result, when they do complete their work, for example, it is often rushed and of lower quality. To gain a deeper understanding of self-control, Dan conducts an experiment on his students. He divides them into three groups: . | Group 1 has the freedom to choose their own deadlines for submitting three papers throughout the semester, but they will lose one percent of their grade for each day of delay. | Group 2 has no specific deadlines and only has to submit the papers by the end of the semester. | Group 3 has deadlines set by Dan himself. | . Group 1 faced a dilemma in setting their deadlines. They realized that, if they set lenient deadlines, they would be more prone to procrastination. Therefore, most of them wisely utilized their freedom to set reasonable deadlines, with the penalty serving as a restraint of sorts. Group 3 had no choice in setting deadlines, and Group 2 could set individual deadlines without penalties or the need to inform the teacher. When the results came in, on average, Group 3 students achieved the highest grades per paper, followed by Group 1, and Group 2 performed the worst. The lesson proved two-fold: . | Penalties, rather than incentives, may prove more efficient in regards to curbing procrastination | In some cases, it may be more effective for a third party to dictate deadlines rather than individuals deciding for themselves | . Although a simple solution to combat procrastination would be to have a third party enforce deadlines, Dan acknowledges that this approach is somewhat Orwellian. Instead, he decides to apply the idea of a penalty in synthesis with the idea of a third-party in a couple examples. We could save a significant amount of money and potentially even our lives by regularly attending checkups. Alatts, our lack of self-control usually leads to us foregoing these checkups. But what if we had $200 riding on attendance? And, even worse, $200 of our own money? By holding an advance payment until you attend your scheduled checkup, your doctor can cleverly force you to attend! This synthesizes the idea of a penalty ($200 of our own money), and a third-party (the doctor). Another idea is for a user to set governors on their spending &amp; borrowing on a credit card. If they exceed these limits, the smart card of sorts sends a notification to their family informing them of their fiscal irresponsibility, or taxes them a certain amount (which goes to charity). Here, the penalty is the tax or the shame, and the third-party is the smart-card itself. ",

    "content": "Ownership is not limited to material things. It can also apply to points of view. Once we take ownership of an idea–whether it’s about politics or sports–what do we do? We love it perhaps more than we should. We prize it more than it is worth. And most frequently, we have trouble letting go of it because we can’t stand the idea of its loss. What are we left with then? An ideology–rigid and unyielding. We tend to value our possessions, especially the ones that figure most often in our lives, far more than a foreign objective observer would. This is why we often believe our possessions will sell for far more than potential buyers are willing to pay, and fail to sell them as a result. As Dan states: . Ownership prevades our lives and, in a strange way, shapes many of the things we do. Adam Smith wrote, “Every man [and woman]… lives by exchanging, or becomes in some measure a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is properly a commercial society.” . That’s why it’s good to keep an inherent sense for what things are worth, both for selling and purchasing. If you were buying a home, wouldn’t it be great if your brain automatically calculated a quality:price ratio, where the quality also accounted for your personal preferences? We could manually figure something similar out, but unfortunately our biases prevent us. This is for three of our brain’s quirks: . | We fall in love with what we already have, and in so doing let our emotions cloud objective evaluation. The entire concept of an ‘heirloom’ explains this well. The heirloom may be a worthless item, but our emotional attachment gives it its own value. | We also tend to focus on what we may lose rather than what we may gain. If you’re selling a car, you’re more likely to worry about how you will lose the use of the car rather than the utility of the money gained by selling it. | Finally, we expect the other participant in the transaction to view the matter as we do–emotionally. But, say a buyer, is more likely to measure the utility of the aforementioned heirloom objectively rather than based on emotional appeal. | . Dan claims that all these quirks and biases are the result of ‘ownership’. As in, we feel for what own. The more you work for an item, the more ‘ownership’ you feel for it. Sometimes, we feel ownership before we even own something. This feeling is most visible in auctions, where it encourages us to bet more and more. Marketers try to exploit this fact. Trials, for example, lead to us feeling ownership over the particular item being trialled. Eventually, we lose the strength to end the trial! Similar is the ‘30-day money back guarantee’; sure, you can always return the item if it’s not worth the money. But are we really capable of objectively evaluating and comparing the worth and utility of the items after we have ‘claimed ownership’ over it? Dan would say no. ",

    "content": "In 210 BC, a Chinese commander named Xiang Yu led his troops across the Yangtze River to attack the army of the Qin (Ch’in) dynasty. Pausing on the banks of the river for the night, his troops awakened in the morning to find, to their horror, that their ships were burning. They hurried to their feet to fight off their attackers, but soon discovered that it was Xiang Yu himself who had set their ships on fire, and that he had also ordered all the cooking pots crushed. Xiang Yu explained to his troops that without the pots and the ships, they had no other choice but to fight their way to victory or perish. That did not earn Xiang Yu a place on the Chinese army’s list of favorite commanders, but it did have a tremendous focusing efefct on his troops: grabbing their lances and bows, they charged ferociously against the enemy and won nine consecutive battles, completely obliterating the main-force units of the Qin dynasty. Xiang Yu acts opposite to common-sense in this story; a normal human strives to keep as many doors open as possible. Not only would we preserve our food and ships, we would make sure of some sort of backup for both–live to fight another day. We can not stand the idea of closing doors. We often do this to the detriment of our productivity. After all, keeping doors open costs a lot of effort. And when we take decisions intending to keep doors open, we often give up something in exchange. To illustrate this, Dan holds an experiment. He has different volunteers play two different versions of a video game: . | In the normal version, students have three doors they can ‘click’ into. Once inside a room, they can click the screen and they obtain a random amount of money, added to a counter. They have a 100 clicks, going into and out of a room costs one click, and there is a room which earns them the most money per click. The goal is, obviously, to find that room as quickly as possible and click away the rest of your clicks. | In a slightly changed version, the same rules apply. But, if you haven’t visited a room in the last twelve clicks, it disappears permanently. | . The students who played the first version played rationally. They went into a random room, sampled its money offerings, went into the next room, and so on. Once they had sampled all the rooms, they quickly determined which had earned them the most on average, went into it, and clicked the rest of their clicks in that room. Our rationale for the second game should be the exact same. Nothing has fundamentally changed, after all. Even the limit of twelve clicks before an unvisited room disappears can be accounted for: we just have to spend less time sampling each room. But, when they played that version, most students obsessed themselves with keeping all the doors open instead of finding the most efficient room. They earned around 15% less money on average. As Dan summarizes: . In 1941 the philosopher Erich Fromm wrote a book called Escape from Freedom. In a modern democracy, he said, people are beset not by a lack of opportunity, but by a dizzying abundance of it. In our modern society this is emphatically so. We are continually reminded that we can do anything and be anything we want to be. The problem is in living up to this dream. We must develop ourselves in every way possible; must taste every aspect of life; must make sure that of the 1,000 things to see before dying, we have not stopped at number 999. But then comes a problem–are we spreading ourselves too thin? . Our desire to keep doors open is harmful, but keeping doors that are worthless or even harmful open simply compunds the problem. And there are in fact disappearing doors in our life, but we are often too obsessed with keeping other doors open to realize. Dan gives the example of a father too obsessed with studying to realize his children’s childhood is slipping away. If we want to live a healthy life, we must close down as many of these worthless doors as possible. But the struggle goes on. Picking between two similar options is often as tough as closing down doors. In these sort of choices, we often grind the issue down into small details that we bicker over endlessly. In so doing, we tend to ignore the consequences of not choosing at all! . ",

The format itself is: . | Bring up example | Talk about how it’s related to your hypothesis | Talk about how you experimented on your hypothesis | What we can learn from it all | . Certainly, a solid application of the scientific method (mostly), but it gets dry for the layman reader. I can’t personally confirm whether most–or even any–of the lessons outlined are valid, but they seem reasonable to me. But what I do know is that, as the chapters go on, Dan tries to explain the same problems of the human condition that many other materialists have tried to. No offense, but this is certainly taking on a task that is somewhat above him, or at least above the topic of behavioral economics. At the same time, he draws increasingly sketchy conclusions from his experiments. They leave me with that instinctual feeling that ‘there’s something wrong here’. I’ve stopped my notes past Chapter 9 for this reason. ",

    "content": "Do you know the secret of the true scholar? In every man there is something wherein I may learn of him; and in that I am his pupil. George Bernard Shaw once wrote thus: ‘chess is a foolish expedient for making idle people believe they are doing something very clever, when they are only wasting their time’. In the same vein, it is easy to dismiss philosophy as a waste of the energies of intelligent men, when you see science constantly advancing and philosophers still stuck on the same arguments as centuries ago. But, as Will puts it, ‘this is only because philosophy accepts the hard and hazardous task of dealing with problems not yet open to the methods of science […] so soon as a field of inquiry yields knowledge susceptible of exact formulation it is called science. Every science begins as philosophy and ends as art.’ And, indeed, many of the earliest ‘scientists’ were philosophers first, and the term for the sciences was originally ‘natural philosophy’. To put it in simpler terms, in the realm of science, the scientist is partial. He need only ‘describe the fact’; the philosopher is not content with just that, however, as many facets of life are not reducible to simple ‘facts’, and thus he must take up the ‘hard and hazardous task’ of deciphering these areas. For instance, could you reduce human ethics to simple facts? If you could, life would be much simpler, but alas you can not. Thus, science leaves ethics untouched, and renders it the sole domain of the philosophers. Maybe one day we will come upon some mythical technique to reduce morality to fact, in which case it would pass on from being philosophy and into a science (unlikely, however). To put it to an end, ‘science gives us knowledge, but only philosophy can give us wisdom’. Philosophy is generally divided into five fields: logic, aesthetics, ethics, politics, and metaphyics. Logic is the study of reasoning, thought, deduction and induction. Aesthetics deals with the study of form, beauty, or the philosophy of art. Ethics deals with the study of human conduct, good and evil. Politics is the study of social organization. And, finally, metaphysics is the study of reality, the nature of matter and mind and their relation. Though he gives us these categories, Will dislikes utilizing them; he thinks them an attempt at dismembering and formalizing the ‘joy of understanding’. Instead of going topic-by-topic – as you would in a science – he prefers to examine the topic personality-by-personality. “We shall study not merely philosophies, but philosophers”, he says. ",

    "content": "2.1 – The Context of Plato . Greece in the Classical Age was very much a divided land. Shattered and mountainous geography made travel and communication overland (let alone amongst the various islands) dangerous and difficult. But it was this isolation that allowed each city-state to develop its own government, instutitions, language, and culture. In that sense, Classical Greece was very much a playground of ideas. Their exposure to the seas also led to the Greeks, notably the Athenians, developing a maritime flavor. After the first (successful) war with the Persians, Athens became a center of trade. It become a sort of melting pot, and with prosperity and education came the search for knowledge. The first philosophers focused on the material world (Democritus to begin, and his successors Epicurus and Lucretius), but there was a parallel tendency – the Sophists – who looked within themselves, rather than upon the world. The Sophists divided into two political lines: the first arguing, along the lines of Rousseau, that all men were equal, only divided by institutions, law, and the other gifts of civilization. The other argued the opposite, as Nietzche later did: all men are unequal, that society must (and will naturally come to) be ruled by the strong, essentially arguing in favor of the aristocratic class. At the time, Athens was hardly a democracy as we know the political system in the modern world. But it did have some limited democratic elements in political decision-making, and the aristocratic class lamented this greatly. During the Peloponnesian War between Athens and its rival Sparta, said aristocratic class secretly admired the rival Spartan system; these aristocrats were exiled during the war, but were brought back when the Athenians surrendered. Post-war, they led a failed revolt against the system that they claimed had lost Athens the war. The revolution was led by a man named Critias, a pupil of Socrates and uncle of Plato. 2.2 – Socrates . Such was the end of our friend, whom I may truly call the wisest, the justest, and best of all the men whom I have ever known. Will brings us an interesting perspective on Socrates: we know very little of him – he penned no works, after all – and yet, because all our knowledge of him is informed through Plato (and other writers’) intimate scripts, we know him far better than we know Aristotle or even Plato himself. The acolytes of Socrates were a diverse crowd, and perhaps the origin of every school of social thought in the West could be traced to his group. The man himself was somewhat of a vagabond, relying on the patronage of his disciples, and his disciples certainly patronized him. He was a modest man, which certainly endeared him to others; his intellectual modesty is captured in one of his more famous anecdotes: the Oracle of Delphi once declared that there was no man living wiser than Socrates. Socrates took this as an affirmation of his principle that ‘I know that I know nothing’ – because he was wise enough to know that he knew nothing, he was wiser than all. Of the many philosophers preceding – and contemporaneous to – him, Socrates deserves note for first taking on matters of the mind. His predecessors, famous names amongst them like Pythagoras and Parmenides, mostly focused on matter, physics, and metaphysics (the three topics together known generally as cosmology). Where these men focused on the bigger-picture, Socrates was the first to seriously consider the individual and the matters that affected him daily. This was an important issue at the time. The Sophists had destroyed faith in the Gods, and took the morality and ethics bestowed upon the Athenians by said Gods with them as well. To save Athenian society, it was necessary to develop a new ethics and a new morality, lest everyone simply surrender to their passions and let anarchy reign. This system of morality would be independent of theology such that both the religious and the atheist could abide by it, and come and go what religions might, it would stay. For Socrates, the highest virtue was wisdom and reason, and his morality took form around this fact. The good man was the intelligent man, who took action by his knowledge, and the evil man an ignorant fool who would do better if he were merely educated. To Socrates, being ‘moral’ was natural. No evil man would ever be happy, only the good man would be truly satisfied in life. Therefore, evildoers must be merely ignorant, stray sheep, who do evil because they do not know better. (But what is good, and what is evil, in his view?) . On a larger scale, an intelligently administered society would be one where the individual will gain more in security than he loses in liberty. With every individual within this society, ideally, intelligent and thus moral, peace and order would be ensured. No one would have righteous motivations in agitating for anarchy, as they did in the Athens of Socrates’ time, since society would be perfect. But, in fact, Athens was not the utopia that Socrates envisioned. In the chaos of Athenian government, how could we convince people to obey the laws of a state so thoughtless? How could we convince the people that, in the crowd, there was in fact no wisdom to be found? In fact, it is quite the opposite – crowds are often more violent and foolish than men alone. How could we convince people that they need only be led by the most intelligent men amongst them? . Thus, Socrates ‘moral intellectualism’ (the term for his moral philosophy), influenced his – decidedly aristocratic – political philosophy. Many of his disciples were aristocrats themselves, the aforementioned Critias and Plato amongst them, likely attracted to him by his thoughts in this regard. After the defeat of Athens in the Peloponnesian War, the Spartans restructured Athenian society and government along their lines. An oligarchy called the ‘Thirty’ were installed, and Athenian democracy was dismantled. Amongst the Thirty was Critias, in a group of Five that were the most powerful of the bunch. He was responsible for a sort of post-war Terror – summary executions, property confiscations, etc. Eventually, Critias was overthrown and democracy was restored. Despite his objections (and outright subordination, at one point) to Critias’ conduct, Socrates was essentially dubbed the intellectual leader behind the Thirty, put to (a now infamous) Trial, and executed. 2.3 – The Preparation of Plato . I thank God that I was born Greek and not barbarian, freeman and not slave, man and not woman; but above all, that I was born in the age of Socrates. Plato had been part of the aristocratic class, as mentioned previously. His name ‘Plato’ referred to his physical vigor – he had been, variously, a soldier and athlete. Eventually, after meeting Socrates, he took an interest in matters of wisdom. He also had an extreme fondness of his teacher which, after his execution, morphed into a hatred of his opponents – the ‘mob’, and its enabling system ‘democracy’. Socrates was executed in the year 399 B.C., and Plato fled Athens that very same year, likely for fear of his safety. It functioned less an exile, however, and more to greatly broaden his horizons. He sailed to Egypt, Italy, and some say he wandered all the way to the Ganges. Regardless of the specifics, he returned to Athens in 387 B.C. a changed man. Plato was seen as somewhat of a hybrid philosopher-poet-scientist-artist, and his artistic flair certainly showed in his works. His works on Socrates taking the form of dialogues, much like how a dramatist writes out his works, is one example of this. It also served to make his works more easily understandable. The author makes mention of Plato’s hypocrisy: He complained of poets as myth-makers, when he himself has quite a few myths to his names; he complained of priests, but even moreso than most philosophers, he could be taken for a preacher; he condemned the Sophists, and yet his arguments were not always as sound as you’d think. But Plato’s works, the Republic most of all, remain the cornerstone of Western philosophy. 2.4 – The Ethical Problem . The Republic begins with a discussion of morality. As in all the dialogues, Socrates questions Cephalus (in whose house this discussion is taking place). Socrates questions him about the value of wealth. Cephalus believes that wealth enables one to be generous, honest, and just, and says as much (falling into Socrates’ trap). Socrates then asks him what he means by ‘just’ and ‘justice’. Cephalus struggles in vain against, essentially, a trick question, but is eventually prodded into vocalizing a morality: ‘might is right, and justice is the interest of the mighty,’ he says. This proto-Nietzchean sentiment was common in these times and is shown in many of Plato’s other dialogues, and in general Greek literature of the time. For instance, Thucydides recording ‘the strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must’ shows the manifestation of this idea in foreign policy. The idea of a slave-morality used to chain the strong was seen in contradiction to actual virtue: the hero-morality, based on intelligence and courage rather than any justice; though one could say that this is amoralism rather than any ‘hero-_morality_’. When asked on his answer to the aforementioned question, Plato has Socrates dodge the question. Instead, he has us examine the community as a whole. After all, justice and morals do not exist in a vacuum. We can only be just to other people, kind to other people, e.t.c. A top-down deconstruction of morality, community, society, among other topics; that is the Republic. 2.5 – The Political Problem . As to the people, they have no understanding, and only repeat what their rulers are pleased to tell them. – (Protagoras, 317) . Plato begins by describing, essentially, the Garden of Eden. Where man lives in harmony with nature. A life of peace, vegetarianism (brought up in the context of a healthy diet), and family. This sort of Utopia is religious in nature; where man lives simply, with ‘praises of the gods on their lips’, and with his family by his side. But Plato destroys this idea with as much ease as he brings it up. If this Utopia were so satisfactory to man, then why is it so hard to find on Earth? In reality, man is not content with a simple life. He oft succumbs to greed and luxury, as in the Fall of Man, where Adam succumbed to temptation and condemned us all from this Utopia. Regardless of the reasons, Utopia is not the lot of man; we compete with each other out of selfish greed, take from others as they take from us. We learn trade and finance, and from there the City develops, in which we find even worse divisions. Of this, Plato says “Any ordinary city is in fact two cities, one the city of the poor, the other of the rich, each at war with the other; and in either division there are smaller ones – you would make a great mistake if you treated them as single states” (423). Eventually, the merchants of the city overtake the landowners of the countryside in wealth and aristocracy gives way to oligarchy. Whereas in aristocracy men were ruled by the few, resulting in a narrow-minded and out-of-touch elite, oligarchy ruins states by inordinate greed. Both produce the same end, however: revolution. And thus comes democracy, where the people have an equal share of freedom and power. But democracy has its share of flaws. It gives the people power over their fate, but people are fickle and easily-deceived. Eventually, we come upon Tyranny; the mob is easily riled, and with great powers given to the mob, we often see it support a Dictator into power. The Dictator is not competent, he is merely eloquent and speaks only of what people want want to hear. This is a natural consequence of democracy, Plato argues, where men invite not the skilled but the cunning into government. To ensure rule by the competent is the main issue of Political Philosophy, in Plato’s opinion. 2.6 – The Psychological Problem . Like man, like state. – (575) . Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness and wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who pursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will never have rest from their evils. – (473) . Plato’s indulges in historicism in the above chapter, but he does not forget about Man, the Individual, and his nature. He does not commit the fallacy that asserts the State as independent of the people it rules over. Men are the building blocks of the State, and their collective nature – culture – shapes the State, regardless of whether they actually have any influence over politics. For Plato, men are motivated by either desire, emotion, or knowledge. Desire and emotion are different in that desire represents the baser, animalistic parts of men, and emotion can contain noble parts like spirit, ambition, e.t.c. In every man, all three are present, but to varying proportions. In Plato’s estimation, the men of desire are those who reign over the material world. Your aforementioned oligarchs, aristocrats, and politicians. The men of emotion care not so much for the spoils of war, as for the thrill of the fight. Your generals and admirals. And finally, the men of knowledge, philosophers like Plato. When the men of desire or the men of emotion reign over the State, they attempt to use it to their ends, and bring it to ruin in so doing. The ideal arrangement would be one in which the men of desire would reign over the market, the men of emotion over the battlefield, and their efforts would be harnessed and coordinated by the men of knowledge in office – the infamous “philosopher-king”. 2.7 – The Psychological Solution . To begin this process of Utopia-ification, Plato suggests that we begin with the next generation. We seize for the city all children, and banish their parents to the country so that we may begin from a clean slate. The children must then be put through an education. For the first ten years, this will take the form of physical exercise. This will ensure their health in perpetuity and finally end the physicians of their miserable professions. This can be considered part of the ‘nurture’ side of eugenics. A philosopher-bigman himself, Plato knew strength was not all there was to life. In fact, prize-fighters, athletes, and weight-lifters were not great examples of the gentle nature that Plato wished to imbue everyone with. He comes up with an interesting idea to counteract any accrued brute-ness: music. Plato gave great weight to music; he thought it moulded character, with its rhythms and harmonies. “Let me make the songs of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws,” he says. Music offers access into the mind, unlike any other. If there were a medicine for diseases of the mind, then it would be music. Going with the psychological theme, Plato invents a sort of proto-psychoanalysis. He brings attention to dreams, notably, to study mans’ desires and instincts, for sleep time is when a man’s basest desires seep out. “In all of us, even in good men, there is such a latent wild beast nature, which peers out in sleep.” (572). But too much music, like too much exercise, would make you a dandy. After a certain age, the individual practice of music must be abandoned; though communal music (and communal games), would continue. Plato urges the use of music in tandem with the more dreary studies of the sciences and history to make them easier to consume, but also cautions against forcing these subjects onto the unwilling student. With healthy bodies and healthy minds, we now turn to rearing their spirits and hearts. We must remind them that they are part of a community, and what better way to do this than religion? More specifically, a God, and not some metaphysical-cosmic-higher force. It must be a personal God. Even more specifically, this God must offer us some sort of personal immortality, to reward us for our good deeds and suffer us for our sins. And it will surely do us no harm if this God were false, to believe regardless. At the age of 20, the children will be subject to a trial the likes of which the word ‘examination’ would do no justice. It will test every faculty; those who would fail would be consigned to handywork and other sorts of lower-works (see: men of desire). After ten more years of training, another test will occur at age 30, for those who did not fail the first. However, this is where religion will come to play; for, what would satisfy those consigned to the lower classes (those of silver, brass, and iron), other than God? You may be incompetent, but to do well and do good and you shall surely be rewarded in the afterlife. Philosophy is all well and good, but for the young it merely manifests as a game of skepticism. In reality, philosophy is: metaphysics, to think clearly; and politics, to rule wisely. To put philosophy to use, they must learn the doctrine of Ideas, the theory of Forms. But what is an Idea? The meaning is vague; the Idea of a thing may be the general class (i.e. human, plant, animal, gun) it belongs to, or it may be the laws it operates according to (i.e. natural laws, the laws of physics). It may be both; the ideal, and the mechanisms behind the surface. One thing is for sure: an Idea is permanent; the particular manifestations of the Idea do not encompass all of the Idea. You may eat an apple, you may eat all the apples, but the idea of an Apple goes on. Whether that be the surface image or taste of an Apple, or the inner workings, the atoms, of an Apple, or both. It is worth noting that Plato’s conception of inner workings were intrinsically mathematic; since most modern sciences sprouted from mathematics, mathematics and science were one and the same to the Greeks. And what is science if not the search for inner workings? As Galileo once said, ‘Mathematics is the alphabet with which God has written the universe’. That is why Plato placed, over the doors of his Academy, the words ‘Let no man ignorant of geometry enter here’. It is the nature of man, when he encounters new things, to look for similarities in things he already knows. If it weren’t for these Ideas, we would not be granted that leisure, if everything were unique and unmeaning. The beginnings of science were in categorization, classification, and investigation of Ideas instead of just observing surface reality and the manifestations of Ideas. Instead of looking at a rotten apple as distinct from a regular apple, we figure that they are of the same Idea and ask ‘what caused this apple to rot, that did not affect this other apple?’. This is science, the beginnings of the scientific method. Five years of training in these forms follows for those students of ‘gold’ that passed the last two examinations. But their work (thirty-five years counting) is not done yet, for now they are to spend fifteen years living in the world they have learned so much about with only their accumulated thirty-five years of learning. Those that survive this trial by fire shall be the rulers of the state. 2.8 – The Political Solution . Democracy means the perfect equality of opportunity, but it should not be to the detriment of merit. It should not mean rotation, but ascension. In this sense, public officials must not be chosen by voting, but by their merits and achievements; the ‘democratic’ element here is the fact that every man, equally, has an opportunity to be tested for public office. ‘But’, you might say, ‘is this not in fact aristocracy?’. You would be right, but Plato makes a valid point: if aristocracy would lead to the ‘best’ outcome, why should we not embrace it? Do not let words scare you, let reality do the talking. Still, words have connotations and histories, and aristocracies’ history is checkered; Plato’s aristocracy is assuredly not the middle-ages, feudal hereditary aristocracy. It is a ‘democratic aristocracy’. There is an elite, but the elite is open to all; all classes, all castes, all people. It has only one criterion to entry: competence. There are no pretensions, and this democracy is thus more honest than any other, including the elective democracies. An objection is raised: philosophers you are training our young leaders to be, but are not philosophers utterly unpractical? Do they not obsess over trivial questions, and become ‘strange beings’? Are they not truly useless to the world? (Ouch.) Plato does not truly deny the accusation (of philosophers having their heads in the clouds), but that the last stage of their training will ensure they are men of action, not merely of thought. To prevent from corruption and other moral faults, Plato argues that the officials have no property beyond necessity; they will live like, and with, the commoners. They will not indulge in worldly luxury, for God will endow them a reward more satisfactory than any you could find on Earth. They will also have no family; their devotion must solely be to the community. They will have children, but they shall be taken from their mother at birth. On the note of women, Plato makes a case for complete equality in this political and educational system of his. Of course, Plato also makes an argument for eugenics. He expands the example of selective breeding of animals to the selective breeding of humans. “education should begin before birth” (Laws, 789). Offspring born of unlicensed matings, or deformed, are to be left to die. The best of the ‘flock’ must mate with the best, and the inferior with the inferior. The community must not ignite war with external enemies, but sometimes the flames reach you regardless. In this case, it is necessary to have a soldier class. But precautions must be taken to avoid war: by means of restricting overpopulation, and by avoiding foreign trade (Plato is curiously in complete opposition to the idea that trade restricts war, asserting the opposite). He makes a case for the city being inland, landlocked, to avoid the vices of navies and merchants. Finally, he makes a case for a pan-Hellenic league of the whole Greek race, to prevent the most common of wars (the civil war). This society would be perfectly structured: the aristocratic class at the top, austere, dedicated to community, and supremely competent; below them, their adjutants; finally, the handymen and the lowest. But all will be satisfied, and none will be impoverished regardless of class. This is the just state. 2.9 – The Ethical Solution . If we are to have a just state, we must first have an understanding to what constitutes ‘justice’. Plato’s definition is: “Justice is the having and doing what is one’s own” (433). Meaning something like the golden rule, but a bit more practical and general. Essentially, justice (in a society at large) is when each man produces as much as he receives, and when he performs the function he is most fit for. Thus, Plato’s emphasis on a perfectly ordered society with an advanced division of labor. On an individual level, the same definition holds. Justice is coordination, where each element of a man makes an equal, harmonious contribution to his behavior. Let any desire, emotion, or idea take hold to the detriment of others, and man shall fall into chaos (and injustice). All evil is disharmony. An individual may be stronger for embracing his desires completely, or shutting them out completely; but, he will not survive the death of personality that results. Nature will punish him for his injustice, towards himself and to others. 2.10 – Criticism . Plato’s Republic was in fact, and in some measure, realized in the Europe of the middle ages. Society at large was then classified into three groups: the laboratores (workers), bellatores (soldiers), and oratores (clergy). The clergy functioned as the sort of ruling class that Plato desired: austere, educated, cultured, chosen on merit not by the poll. They were even celibate. Much else of the Church in Rome was influenced by Plato; their curriculums, their cosmology, and the more prominent ideas of Christianity were publicized on account of Plato’s expectations of religion (see: the popularity of heaven &amp; hell, salvation, etc). With this, the Church exercised an influence over such vast swathes of Europe. The Church as an institution is still alive, more than a thousand years on. Many examples of modernist groups, from the Soviets to the Ayatollahs of Iran, each promising Utopia, take much inspiration from Plato, whether they realized it themselves or not. Critics of Plato argue on a couple points. First, the differences that make humanity unique would be smothered completely by this Republic. The individuality of each man would be put down completely by his communism. Aristotle makes this argument. More practically, certain ideas of his, like abolishing monogamy, were seen as impractical and perhaps delusional. Certainly, abolishing the family can be written about, but actually putting the idea into practice might have undue effects that even Plato couldn’t foresee. Will asserts these criticisms as pointless, because it is only the aristocratic class that will have to bear the smothering of individuality, the absence of family. The majority will be unaffected. But this leads to some problems. If we hand all the economic power to the lowest of the three classes, would that not incite revolution? Like when the merchant middle-classes, growing wealthier than the aristocrats, took up arms against the ancien régime? . This practical objection is perhaps the greatest. Going back to the Church’s example: the Church did in fact prosper for centuries, but that was only when most of Europe was agrarian. Will makes the case that farmer populations are more inclined to superstition on account of their lack of control over their harvests, and their dependence on the elements. When commerce and industry – and with them a class of more realist men – began to prosper, the Church very quickly collapsed. Thus, the greatest argument against Plato’s Republic would be that it is firmly opposed to change. So strictly structured, any change that would come to the Republic would be change that it would only accept after collapse. As Sparta collapsed, as the Church’s authority collapsed, and as the Soviet Union collapsed – all because they refused to accept change, so too would this Republic eventually collapse. Granted, Plato’s Republic was purely theoretical, and he himself never expected it to be put perfectly to practice. In an anecdote, Plato received an invitation from Dionysius, the ruler of Syracuse, to turn his city into a Republic. Plato agreed, but found himself lost at the first step: Dionysius wished to be king, sole ruler, while Plato’s Republic was not a monarchy. Either Dionysius would become a philosopher, or he would cease to be king. Dionysius had Plato sold into slavery. This experience certainly affected his more conservative later works, like Laws. At the age of eighty, Plato was invited to the wedding feast of one of his pupils. Tired after the merry-making, Plato retreated to a corner and took a nap. When the feast was over, revellers attempted to wake him, only to find that he had passed peacefully, in his sleep. ",

    "title": "3 – Aristotle and Greek Science",
    "content": "3.1 – The Historical Background . Aristotle was born in the year 384 BC at Stagira, 200 miles north of Athens in Macedonia. He was brought up in a family of physicians. He later arrived at Plato’s Academy and became the great man’s pupil; Plato lavished him with praise – he was the Nous of the Academy. But the relationship between the two was contentuous and, according to certain sources, Aristotle started rebelling against his master towards the latter end of his life. Regardless, Aristotle led an active life after the academy. Most famously, he tutored the great Macedonian king Phillip’s son, Alexander (to be the Great). This was no mean posting; Phillip was looking for the greatest teacher in all the world, for his son who was to become ruler of all the world, and Aristotle clearly fit his criterion. Soon after, Phillip would unite the Greeks at Chaeronea, and Alexander would eventually conquer the world. Though Alexander sung his master great praise, one could say Aristotle clearly failed to rein in the barbarian in Alexander. While Alexander was having his adventure, back home at Athens, the Athenians were having none of it. Not ones for being subjugated (for very long, at least), the city was split amongst a pro-Macedonian party and a pro-independence party led by Demosthenes, the famed orator. When Aristotle returned to the city, finished with tutoring Alexander, he took the pro-Macedonian side. During his next twelve years in Athens, Aristotle wrote most of his works. 3.2 – The Work of Aristotle . Aristotle established the Lyceum when he was 53, and it was (obviously) popular. The school was different from Plato’s mathematical and politics-based Academy; Aristotle’s was focused on biology and the natural sciences. Aristotle’s influence over these fields can not be exaggerated. Most of this was boosted by Alexander, who often granted Aristotle’s requests regarding funds, research (as in an expedition to the source of the Nile), and who probably sourced of most of the flora and fauna Aristotle documented. Regardless, no amount of funding could make up for the fact that, back then, basically none of the equipment we take for granted in the modern sciences existed. The Greeks, for all their glory, were near disdainful of these elements that are so necessary to science nowadays. Aristotle was trekking uncharted territory, and he had to create his own compasses along the way. Aristotle was certainly a magnificent polymath; His works covered logic, rhetoric, the sciences, to the ethic and politics of his predecessor, and so much more. He was certainly a jack of all trades, with an emphasis on the ‘master of none’ part. His works contained many mistakes, though perhaps that was only natural; to harness such vast swathes of knowledge efficiently, one would have to ascend to a higher plane of existence first. Though, there are some questions of authorship, and only a fraction of his output survived, those are questions beyond this book. 3.3 – The Foundation of Logic . Aristotle was the forefather of the field of logic; logic being the art and method of correct thinking. It is both abstract and scientific; it can be reduced to simple rules, but it concerns our thoughts so it is naturally chaotic. Plato and Socrates paid some attention to the concept of logic, otherwise they would have no consistency, but it did not take form till Aristotle. Of utmost importance to logic are definitions, since words (and their definitions), are the smallest part of any argument, and thus the things we must pay most attention to. To Aristotle, definitions consisted of two parts: a class to which the object belongs (ring any bells?), and the specific characteristics that distinguish it amongst the aforementioned class. Aristotle makes an example of man: he is an animal (his class), but his specific characteristic is that he is rational. But Aristotle didn’t just borrow from Plato’s concepts. He differed on the concept of universals: a universal is a member of a class, not a class itself, but it in itself is a subjective and not objective reality. For instance, man is part of the animal class, but there is no one ‘man’; men exist, but there is no ‘universal man’. ‘Man’ is merely a term we use. Plato held these universals as an objective existence, however, and more important than the individuals, also called particulars; of man a particular would be you or me, the term we would use for that particular would be ‘manhood’ or ‘personhood’. Remember: ‘You may eat an apple, you may eat all the apples, but the idea of an Apple goes on.’ . This is where Aristotle disagrees, and he disagrees quite vehemently. Aristotle believed that these abstractions, present throughout Plato’s works, and practically the basis of the Republic, was false. Plato was so obsessed with the universal, that he completely ignored the particular. But Will brings us to the fact that Aristotle criticized Plato because he was so alike him: ‘as only similars can be profitably contrasted, so only similar people quarrel, and the bitterest wars are over the slightest variations of purpose or belief’. Aristotle, despite his criticisms, was also fond of the tool that is the abstraction. For example, the syllogism: a syllogism is a trio of propositions, the first two propositions are used to concede a truth in the final proposition (All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore Socrates is a mortal). Mathematically, we can express this as: A = B; C = A; therefore, B = C. The problem here is that the first premise, here that ‘all men are mortal’, takes for granted the point to be proven. Meaning, it is not impossible for Socrates to be immortal, and Socrates may in fact be immortal, but Socrates being irrational would mean that man is not universally mortal, and the syllogism takes this for granted. By taking for granted any first premise, Aristotle denies particularity in favor of universality. 3.4 – The Organization of Science . 3.4.1 – Greek Science Before Aristotle . Science for the pre-Aristotlean Greeks, and their predecessors and neighbors, was indistinguishable from theology. Everything was the design of God, or even that everything was itself a God. Astronomers were the first of the scientists. They figured that all of the universe had started as one, separated over time. From there, they understood the beginnings of the Earth, the beginnings of life on Earth, and the nature of matter. Greek science was very philosophical; Heraclitus, for instance, took lessons from the nature of matter. That all of matter was the result of strife, and where there is no strife there is decay. Order was the only constant. Democritus and Leucippus took their predecessors to their natural, materialistic conclusion. All of nature was chaos, made up of atoms and the void. There was no God, only the machine that is nature and the universe. The exact details these scientists often got wrong; with no scientific equipment, they had to make do with theorizing. 3.4.2 – Aristotle as a Naturalist . We owe much of our knowledge of the pre-Socratics to Aristotle. Namely, to Aristotle’s desire to disparage and disprove them. Aristotle got some things wrong: he believed that the earth was the center of the universe, against Pythagoras’s view of the Sun as the center. But he also made striking observations, correctly understanding the cycle of rainfall. From there, he understood all of history to be a cycle. Old continents and oceans would disappear, and new ones would appear. Of man going from dark age to enlightenment, only to be struck back down by nature, forever its slave. 3.4.3 – The Foundation of Biology . He who sees things grow from their beginning will have the finest view of them. Aristotle understood life on earth as a spectrum: from the lowest organisms to the highest, from the dead to the living. He considers this because there are species on earth that share as many similarities as they do differences. One thing he marks as certain is that life has grown in power, in intelligence, and in complexity. Despite this sound exactly like evolution, a concept Aristotle’s predecessors elucidated upon, Aristotle rejects this, however, one of his many mistakes. A good example of Aristotle’s cluelessness in some regards is that he thought woean had fewer teeth than men! . But, despite these mistakes, and in true Aristotelian fashion, he essentially fathered the science of biology. He understood the importance of diet in behavior, discerned similarities in many species, and made some frighteningly sharp anticipations: for example, he understood that features common to the genus appeared first, after that features common to the species, and finally features common to the individual; he also understood that, the more complex and specialized a species, the fewer the number of its offspring. These are very specific features, ‘disproven’ by his contemporaries and successors, only rediscovered and proven in modernity. Most notable were Aristotle’s observations on embryology: he raised important questions (such as heredity) and disproved some common myths of the time. 3.5 – Metaphysics and the Nature of God . Aristotle’s metaphysics, as mentioned before, was influenced by his thoughts on natural science. He believed matter would grow to become something greater than itself, it would take up a form. Matter originates not; it existed originally as a void, only considered because it had the possibility of taking up a form. In biological terms, the embryo would be the matter, and the baby its form. The adult would be the form, and the child the matter. And so there is a constant progression in nature. The final destination of this progression, the final cause or entelechy, determines the nature of the progression. What determines the final cause? The internal, natural structure of the matter; as a human child can not become a bird, nor can a baby bird become a human adult. Aristotle conceived of God as a ‘mover’. The origin of motion that begins the natural progression outlined above, and also its end; the final purpose of all things. But this leaves a lot of missing pieces in the puzzle of God; his abstraction of God leaves Aristotle to explain God’s action as a contemplation of the essence of things. Therefore his God, as the origin of all things and essence, is condemned to forever contemplating himself. 3.6 – Psychology and the Nature of Art . Aristotle left his mark on psychology as well. He laid the foundations of the law of association, for instance. One the more abstract issues of psychology, such as free will, we find a mixed bag. He attempts to strike down determinism, but his arguments are full of holes. His definition of the soul is also influenced by his biology: the soul is the sum of the powers of the body. A personal soul can exist only in its own body, but the soul is not material, and dies with the body. Part of the soul, the active reason, goes on though; it is the universal, as opposed to the particular element that dies with the body. Aristotle also wrote famed works on esthetics. Art is our outlet for emotional expression and the form of art is as a mirror of nature. Art is not superficial reflection, however, as in the representation of inner workings does it shine. In this way, the best art appeals to the human intellect and emotion and, channeling his Schopenhauer, Aristotle acknowledges this art as the highest form of joy we can experience. Art should aim at unity, the focus of form. In the realm of emotions, the true power of art is in catharsis, the purging of unhealthy emotions. All art should strive to achieve catharsis in their consumers. 3.7 – Ethics and the Nature of Happiness . The supreme question, that we see even philosophy as a means to, is ultimately ‘how do we live a happy life?’. Morals, ethics, esthetics, logic, all are pathways on our journey to answer this question. Happiness is the main goal of life. To answer this question, Aristotle figures we must start at what differs man from other creatures – it is the power of reason, rationality. Happiness in life must be attained by the full function of this unique feature. Aristotle pays more attention to the practical features of ethics; he argues that what is right depends on context. There are some general guidelines he provides, however, in the form of the golden mean. The golden mean is the ‘middle-road’ between two extremes; for instance, between cowardice and recklessness, we find courage, our golden mean. This is generally the correct attitude, but for action context is important, and part of virtue is learning to do good in all situations. In that sense, good is a habit. There are also external aspects to happiness. For instance, Aristotle does not advocate ascetism and acknowledges that, not only do worldly goods grant us happiness, they also save us from unhappiness (as in the tenant who worries over rent payments, and the homeowner who is free from such problems). Perhaps the most important external aspect is friendship: friends are a multiplier on happiness, and friendship is more important than justice on account of the fact that friendship makes justice unnecessary (if all the world was your friend, you would never do any wrong to anyone). But again, Aristotle warns against excess: “he who has many friends has no friend”. He also gives us details on what friendship consists of: friendship implies equality and stability of character on both sides, though Aristotle does argue that unequal relationships (such as that of debtor and creditor) have a degree of friendship like, perhaps, that of a mother for her child. Ultimately, however, the path to happiness lies in the self. Not in sensual pleasure, not in power, but in the mind; in the pursuit of the truth. 3.8 – Politics . 3.8.1 – Communism and Conservatism . Aristotle’s philosophy was not so different from his predecessors, inclined as it was towards aristocracy. But he had reasons beyond his association with the emperor; Athens was far more anarchic in Aristotle’s time than even Plato’s. Aristotle’s conservatism is displayed in a few of his ideas: for one, he believed that faults within the state or the ruler, so long as they were minor, were better tolerated than changed. For the power of the law rested in its stability and tradition, and change in these laws must not be taken lightly. The accumulation of the knowledge of generations upon generations, in a country’s laws, are not irrational or without reason. This is the chief of Aristotle’s critique of Plato’s Republic, which he partly agreed with and partly disagreed with. His critique of Plato’s ascendance of universals, the Republic, over the particulars, the individuals that make up the Republic, make an appearance. No state could flourish when it would suffocate its brightest (the aristocratic class). His psychology also comes into play on the communal nature of the Republic: ‘he who has many friends, has no friend’, and in the same way the whole of a city can not be a community. Neither will love, which emerges when ‘a thing is your own, or that it awakens real love in you’, flourish in the Republic where children are taken away by the state, parents do not know their significant others, and all property may as well be the community’s property. More practically, Aristotle argues that dividing society into three stratums so unequal in economic, martial, and numerical power would only put people down; it would disincentivize and prevent men from striving for better. “This is my class, this is my fate”. The communism of his Republic further demotivates the populace; if you will not get anything for your work, and will not get more for the more work you put in, then you will see little value in work. And if people don’t work, then you can kiss civilization goodbye. The allure of utopia comes from ‘optimism’; utopianists think that human’s are not at fault for society’s ills, but that private property or some function of the state (or lack thereof) is responsible. The reality is that evils in society, and in the state, arise out of the wickedness of human nature – a conclusion the good-natured find hard to come to. Ultimately, Plato’s Republic, despite his attempts at social engineering, will not change the inherent nature of man at large. It will only, temporarily, change the situation man finds himself in. Now, despite his argumentation for the golden mean, Aristotle clearly subscribes to the opposite side of the extreme Plato; to the optimist, the pessimist. He believes that most men are, essentially, worthless, and trying to save or preserve them will invite ruin upon the others who aren’t so worthless. “From the hour of their birth some are marked out for subjection, and others for command.” This is a reflection of a common Greek attitude against manual laborers, and generally against industry, for it extends even to the merchants. Aristotle argues quite viciously against usury for instance, and includes merchants and financiers in his class of slaves. 3.8.2 – Marriage and Education . Aristotle’s conservatism also shines in contrast to Plato’s radicalism on the issue of womens’ rights. Aristotle, quite simply, believed women to be the inferior of men, and only fit as the slaves of their betters. He urges men stay away from women until their late thirties, to take advantage of their freedom in the meantime, and then to marry a women of twenty-some years. By this measure, both male and female will lose their desire and ability to bear children at the same time, and thus avoid quarrels over off-spring. It is also partially motivated by pseudo-science and various myths on reproduction around the time. Aristotle recommends that the State take responsibility for ensuring these ‘maximum’ and ‘minimum’ ages of marriage, and even the rates of population growth. Granted, the Greeks had good reason to worry about population, since they didn’t have the technology, as we do, to make gold out of sand. He also urges the State oversee education. He agrees with Plato on the importance of education on the individual, society, and thus the State. “The citizen should be moulded to the form of government under which he lives.” It is also only through a State-provisioned education that a common unity can be achieved, even among ethnic heterogeneity. He urges education as a means to social engineering, to condition man to control his savage nature. Also to develop social habits, for in isolation does man’s evil nature develop; As Nietzche summed up, “To live alone one must be either a beast or a god, says Aristotle. Leaving out the third case: one must be both – a philosopher”. This is all for the purpose of his conservatism, to avoid revolution. For, Aristotle argues, revolution brings about many consequences; the direct of which are calculable, but the indirect of which are not and will, more often than not, prove disastrous. He also aspires to Plato’s cynical use of religion, ‘[A ruler] should appear to be earnest in the worship of the gods; for if men think that a ruler is religious and reveres the gods, they are less afraid of suffering injustice at his hands, and are less disposed to conspire against him, since they believe that the gods themselves are fighting on his side’. 3.8.3 – Democracy and Aristocracy . Aristotle figured that, if his previous conditions were fulfilled, any form of government would suffice. Still, he had a preference for tyranny: he believed that, as Homer put it, “Bad is the lordship of many; let one be your ruler and master”. This likely because of his association with Alexander and Phillip. For this one man, the law would not apply, for he would exist beyond the law. “Only a ridiculous person would try to make laws to govern the [ruler, for he] would probably respond as did the lions in the story of Antisthenes when the hares harangued the assembly, holding that everyone was to be considered of equal worth: ‘Where are your claws?’” . Aristocracy is still preferable in practice, however, since finding the qualities of perfection required in a single ruler would be near-impossible, or at least too rare to be practicable. The problem with the aristocratic class is that it changes, not with merit, but with money. And thus, the highest offices become open to the highest bidders, not the most capable. When these aristocrats diminish themselves in this infighting, they lose power and democracy arises, where the lower classes assume power. Democracy also has its advantages; Aristotle appraises the crowd more fairly than Plato, and he sees clarity and incorruptibility in it. It takes greater power to corrupt a crowd, and the many likely have a clearer, less biased view of an issue than the few. And yet, it is not impossible to do either, so he still argues aristocracy as superior, as Plato did, on account of the stupidity of the masses. If the people were smarter, more virtuous, and less easily misled, there would be no problem, but alas. Thus, Aristotle ends up at the exact same conclusion as Plato: a hybrid of democracy and aristocracy is necessary, and it would be the ideal state, but he does it with his own twist. This is constitutional government, where we do not assume men to be greater than they are, nor do we embrace a utopian constitution – a golden mean. What should be the ruling class of this state? The class which does not rule in either numbers, nor in nobility, but in combination of both; the middle-class, another application of the golden mean. Aristotle essentially describes the modern form of the state, or we could say invents it, couched in his naked conservatism. 3.9 – Criticism . Of his philosophy, Aristotle is quite clearly no radical. He is a measured realist, and the exact opposite of Plato; he is, ironically, not the golden mean to Plato. But this makes him a brilliant complement to Plato, and he flattens for us, or leads us to flatten, Plato’s faults. But let us criticize him regardless. First, Aristotle’s logic is flawed; he starts from a premise, and thus finds a conclusion. No man really thinks like this, and this is certainly not the scientific method; we start from a hypothetical conclusion, and attempt to prove that conclusion. But Aristotle is the father, and giant of logic, and these criticisms are merely whittling away at a giant wall. Derived from his logic, the fault in Aristotle’s scientific method leaves his work with a lot of faults; he makes a lot of general mistakes, and where he succeeds is in observation, classification, and categorization. When he spends his imagination, it leads him further into mistakes (and brilliancies), completely uncoordinated and diverse as his thought was. His ethics is also derived from his logic, in the sense that it is completely dry. As Will puts it, ‘He gives us a handbook of propriety rather than a stimulus to improvement’. He attributes this to Aristotle’s foreign origin, unrelated to the unruliness and freedom of Athenian thought. “He realized too completely the Delphic command to avoid excess: he is so anxious to pare away extremes that at last nothing is left. He is so fearful of disorder that he forgets to be fearful of slavery; he is so timid of uncertain change that he prefers a certain changelessness that near resembles death”. 3.10 – Death . At the ripe age of 62, in 322 B.C., Aristotle was forced to flee Athens. Alexander had perished, and Athenians had risen up. Aristotle was to be tried, much as Socrates was, as the ideologue of the Macedonians, but he fled the city to avoid the fate of his master’s master. He arrived at Chalcis, but so stricken by his exile, died either by poison or some other illness. In one of the cruel ironies of fate, the same year at the same age, Demosthenes, the firebrand of Greek independence and opposite of Aristotle in this regard, drank poison to save himself from his Macedonian pursuers. Athens, and the Greeks by extension, would fall into discord and infighting, until finally subsumed by the Romans. ",

    "content": "It will not be amiss to distinguish the three kinds, and as it were grades, of ambition in mankind. The first is of those who desire to extend their power in their native country; which kind is vulgar and degenerate. The second is of those who labor to extend the power of their country and its dominion among men; this certainly has more dignity, but not less covetousness. But if a man endeavor to establish and extend the power and dominion of the human race itself over the universe, his ambition is without doubt both a more wholesome thing and a nobler than the other two. 4.1 – From Aristotle to the Renaissance . Alexander’s goal in the conquest of Asia was primarily to spread the glory of Greece unto the senile Orient. There were a few faults in this plan: . | Greek thought was no doubt profound, but Eastern civilization was not so baseless as to be its inferior. | Even if the above were false, people would need more than subjugation to absorb Greek values. | . But most of all, Alexander was not of firm grounding in Greek civilization himself. The Macedonians were barbarian invaders, and the spirit of Macedon could be considered in opposition to that of Greece. So, when he conquered Persia, he ended up absorbing as much Persian culture into Greece as he spread Greek influence into the East. Mostly, this was to suit his political regime, best shown in his proclaiming himself God. Will has a harsh view on this line of thought: he believes Eastern thought as defeatist, apathetic, fatalist; that of the enslaved finding solace in his subjugation. In that sense, he argues, it suited the now subjugated, and dying (if not dead) Greek civilization. Though, he reminds us, thought of this line was always present in Greece, as exemplified by the Stoics. The Epicurean and Stoic schools, further influenced by Roman subjugation, continued this process of ‘pessmizing’ Greece. It was also popular in Rome, of course, when the entirety of Greek thought was concentrated in that direction, and the Romans thought little on their own. For instance, the ruthlessly pessimistic Lucretius believed: heaven and hell did not exist; the Gods (if they even existed) didn’t care much for humans; all world is merely matter, atoms, space, united by laws; everything dies, leads to death. An analogy about Epictetus, a notable Stoic, is recounted by Origen, and displays this attitude quite grimly: . Might you not, then, take Epictetus, who, when his master was twisting his leg, said, smiling and unmoved, ‘You will break my leg;’ and when it was broken, he added, ‘Did I not tell you that you would break it?’ . These attitudes were quite influential in preparing Rome for Christianity, Will asserts. The collapse of the Roman state, a slow and grinding process, also allowed the Church to come to the fore; first under the patronage of the Emperors, and later itself patronizing them. By the thirteenth century, Rome was but one facet of the Church that had influence, exceeding that of the Romans, over most of Europe. Faith triumphed reason, and no philosophy was necessary for its timelessness and universality. Faith would never need change, for it was already perfect. When Arab and Jewish scholars translated the Greeks into their languages, and these translations spread to Christian lands, the Church responded merely by assimilating Platonic and Aristotelian thought into Christianity; as if they were Christians before Christ. Here we see Will’s belief in the clash between the theologians and actual, secular philosophy. He devotes little time to figures such as Aquinas or Augustine. A combination of circumstances brought ‘real’ philosophy and the Greek sciences back into the minds of the Europeans. The Crusades restarted contact with the Orient, and thus lead to an inflow of ideas and goods – like cheap paper. The printing press followed, and boosted the spread of ideas. Naval missions, astronomical observations, and other efforts combined to challenge the Church’s dogma. Defeatism and fatalism were purged; men started believing conquering your fears, rather than letting them conquer you, was preferable. Into this fertile plain, enter, Francis Bacon. 4.2 – The Political Career of Francis Bacon . | Francis was of distinguished lineage; his father was notable himself – as the Keeper of the Great Seal – though overshadowed by his son. His mother was related to the Lord Treasurer, and her father had been a linguist. His mother’s education was no doubt influential in his thought. | The English rise to power, a result of trans-Atlantic trade overshadowing trade over the Mediterranean, also played an instrumental role in developing and spreading his thoughts. | Francis knew from a young age that his goal was ‘the discovery and development of the arts and inventions that tend to civilize the life of man’, and everything towards that end. Politics put a hinder on his plans; his father’s death left him penniless, and he had to rise up on his own merit rather than human relations. This took a lot of effort, and a lot of time, and his penchant for oratory and charisma carried him well throughout it. | Francis was quite a devout monarchist; when his friend the Earl of Essex, who even gifted him an estate, rebelled against the Queen, Francis wrote letter after letter to convince him otherwise. When the Earl was imprisoned, he wrote letter after letter, to the Queen this time, that he be released. The Earl was released, but rebelled again soon after, and this time Francis did not ask that he be pardoned, but took active part in his prosecution. | After hard work, and quite a few mistakes along the way, he managed to obtain the office of Lord-Chancelleor at the age of fifty-seven. | . 4.3 – The Essays . | Francis’s goal, mentioned above, took a a practical form in his striving towards becoming a ‘philosopher-statesman’. He attempted to maintain a balance between his more contemplative, withdrawn philosopher side, and his active political side. His admiration for philosophy was inarguable, and he figured death as preferable to, as Socrates would put it, an ‘unexamined’ life. However, he rated his political and military achievements above his literary and philosophical works. | In The Essays, Francis condensed, with his unmatched prose, ideas inspired heavily by the Epicureans. | He criticized the Stoics harshly; in preparing man for death, and reducing his life to but a progression to death, they increased his fear of death, and wasted his life on Earth. He also considered the end goal of the Stoics ultimately unattainable: “Nature is often hidden; sometimes overcome; seldom extinguished”. He believed the Stoic, in his veneration of restraint, no different from the Hedonist tending only to his desires. He advocated a sort of golden mean. Further, he criticizes the philosopher who devotes himself only to knowledge, and with a somewhat pessimistic undertone asserts: | . Men ought to know that in the theatre of human life it is only for Gods and angels to be spectators. | In all this, Francis deviates from the Christian line of thought so prevalent in his time; he attributes this to Machiavelli. He was quite open to the thoughts of such heretics who asserted that ‘the Christian faith had given up good men in prey to those that are tyrannical and unjust’. The tolerance of Francis’ thought, and his open-mindedness, is best expressed by himself: | . We are beholden to Machiavel, and writers of that kind, who openly and unmasked declare what men do in fact, and not what they ought to do; for it is impossible to join the wisdom of the serpent and the innocence of the dove, without a previous knowledge of the nature of evil; as, without this, virtue lies exposed and unguarded. | Francis was still pious, however, and his philosophy did not make him less pious, but in fact the opposite: | . A little philosophy inclineth a man’s mind to atheism; but depth in philosophy bringeth men’s minds about to religion. For while the mind of man looketh upon second causes scattered, it may sometimes rest in them and go no further; but when it beholdeth the chain of them, confederate and linked together, it must needs fly to Providence and Deity. | Will asserts Francis’s true wisdom in psychology, however. He had a lot to say on the topic of love and marriage: he thought marriage a waste of enterprise, and did not put much stock in love. He himself married late in life. He valued friendship more, though he rushes to remind us that ‘there is little friendship in the world’. | On age, he has this to say: | . Young men are fitter to invent than to judge, fitter for execution than for counsel, and fitter for new projects than for settled business; for the experience of age in things that fall within the compass of it, directeth them; but in new things abuseth them. | Continuing the Greek trend, Francis bemoans industry, however, he does it for the exact opposite reason as Plato and Aristotle. Where the two were pacifists who merely believed that such worldliness was above philosophers, Francis believed that the fault in commerce was that it was a detriment to militarism. In fact, he completely breaks from his predecessors in denouncing pacifism, asserting peace as unbefitting of, and dulling man. Here we can see a good example of Francis’s major breaks with both his Christian and Greek predecessors, and his embrace of more practical and worldly Machiavellian thought. | A conservative through and through, Francis was both a monarchist and opposed revolution for the same reasons as Aristotle. To prevent revolution, he advocated a Kingdom lead by a philosopher-king, administered by a learned aristocracy, and worked by a yeomanry of farmers. | . 4.4 – The Great Reconstruction . | Francis’s goal was a sort of reconstruction of philosophical thought in the Western tradition. This ‘Instaurationis Magnae’ (Great Instauration) took the form of a six-step plan/works: . | Introductory Treatises on the decline of Western philosophical tradition and how to revive it. | Classification of the Sciences to ease understanding and provide a broad view of the sciences. | An elucidation of his Interpretation of Nature. | His attempt at applying the above in the Phenomena of Nature. | Ladder of the Intellect as a representation of the giants whose shoulders have led us to knowledge. | Anticipations of scientific results to expect from his method. | Second (or Applied) Philosophy as an illustration of a Utopianist society which would result from following this method and everything therein. | . | Francis’s grand, Aristotelian-in-scale work would lay the foundations of modern science. | . 4.4.1 – The Advancement of Learning . | The sciences are the pathways to Utopia, and to luminate these roads, Francis seeks to ‘seat the sciences each in its proper place’. This is The Advancement of Learning, and in writing it, Francis has ‘taken all knowledge to be my province’. | Francis stresses the importance of physiology and medicine, but laments how the physicians of his day practice completely individually, uncoordinated; he encourages them to collaborate, to understand their practice by means of experimentation and standardization. More practically, he vouches for euthanasia where death can only be delayed at the cost of pain; he also urges doctors to attempt to elucidate the art of prolonging life, rather than focus merely on the science of treating the ill. | His understanding of psychology is as the study of human behavior. He claims that “chance is the name of a thing that does not exist” and that “what chance is in the universe, so will is in man”. But he does not elaborate on his concepts in this regard. | Francis near-invents sociology: | . Philosophers should diligently inquire into the powers and energy of custom, exercise, habit, education, example, imitation, emulation, company, friendship, praise, reproof, exhortation, reputation, laws, books, studies etc.; for these are the things that reign in men’s morals; by these agents the mind is formed and subdued. | Francis vouches for the study of supernatural and other psychical phenomena, if only for practical reasons: | . Alchemy may be compared to the man who told his sons he had left them gold buried somewhere in his vineyard; where they, by digging, found no gold, but by turning up the mould about the roots of the vines, procured a plentiful vintage. So the search and endeavors to make gold have brought many useful inventions and instructive experiments to light. | Francis also writes on the ‘self-help’ genre of the time, inspired by Machiavelli. He urges us, most of all, to seek knowledge; of ourselves and others: first know thyself, for without knowing ourselves we can not know others, and knowing ourselves would be useless if not as a means to know others. His view on friendship is somewhat cynical: friends are a means to power, and friendship must be completely calculated. His thoughts in this regard express a fear of betrayal, and beg one to ask if this paranoia was caused by, or the cause of, his time in prison. He urges prideful display, for “ostentation is a fault in ethics rather than in politics”. In conversation, even with friends, do not let slip your inner thoughts; question, rather than express; and speak of facts, data, and information more than beliefs and judgments. | Francis also calls to attention the disordered state of not only the sciences, but also efforts in the sciences. Without a dedicated goal to strive towards, disorder in effort is a matter of course. To resolve this issue, he urges the creation of a philosophy of sciences; as if the philosophy of a science were a sheperd guiding disordered scientific progress onwards. A unitary thread. | Ultimately, Francis expresses a love for philosophy as like a religion; he recommends philosophy as a cure for all sorts of ailment, from politics to the sciences. But he understands the importance of science especially well, and he expresses in his works both the particulars (his ‘Baconian’ scientific method, for instance) and the general way to ‘do’ science, such that his ideas influenced much of how universities and other centers of learning operate. Francis is refreshingly optimistic about the future of mankind, and is willing to ‘stake all on the victory of art over nature in the race’. | . 4.4.2 – The New Organon (Novum Organum) . | But, is his confidence not unfounded? Little progress had been made past where the Greeks had left the sciences, so why did Francis hold so much hope? Well, because he would lead the vanguard of this restoration with his New Organon. Francis held hope for the future of the sciences, because the future was in his hands. | His main critique comes against the Greeks, thus the name ‘New Organon’. Namely, he criticizes the Greeks for spending too much time on theory, and too little on observation; they attempted to make up for what they lacked in observation with thought and logic, but such an effort is either inefficient or impossible. Thought should be the aide of observation, and putting thought above observation is foolhardy. | These errors in our lines of thinking have led us to false ‘idols’. Francis determines a number of these idols: . | Idols of the Tribe: ‘Man is the measure of all things’, which is to say that our senses may deceive us in observation, or we can not harness their powers successfully. This results in a distorted observation. For example, Francis gives us: “the human understanding, from its peculiar nature, easily supposes a greater degree of order and regularity in things than it really finds … Hence the fiction that all celestial bodies move in perfect circles”. Another manifestation of this fallacy is working from the conclusion to the justification or, as Francis puts it, “the human understanding, when any proposition has been once laid down (either from general admission and belief, or from the pleasure it affords), forces everything else to add fresh support and confirmation”; our innate biases, basically. | To fight against idols of these sort, Francis recommends that every ‘student of nature’, whenever his mind comes to a satisfactory conclusion unprompted, hold that particular conclusion in extreme suspicion; for, it is likely, that this is merely our biases acting. Furthermore, we must make our efforts towards a conclusion even and clear, and hang the wings of our imagination with weights ‘to keep it from leaping and flying’. | Idols of the Cave: If the Idols of the Tribe are common amongst all humanity, Idols of the Cave are peculiar to the individual. “For every one … has a cave or den of his own, which refracts and discolors the light of nature”. Some people are inclined entirely towards conservatism, some towards progress; a scientist must maintain, however, the golden mean. | Idols of the Marketplace: Essentially, misunderstandings from the misuse of language. | Finally, Idols of the Theatre which are other people’s caves migrating into our minds; namely, philsophers. Which is to say, other people’s biases that influence our thought; we can call them second-hand biases. | . | With all the fluff out of the way, Francis gives us his scientific method of inquiry: first, there is simple experience (empirical) which can be accidental; planned experience involves first ‘light[ing] the candle’ (our hypothesis) and using it to illuminate the way (our arguments and experimentations); finally, we arrive at axioms, which we can use in further experiments to establish more axioms. | However, to have too many axioms would be pointless or worse. We must have a means, within the scientific method of induction, to cancel out the various hypotheses until only one, true conclusion remains. | One useful technique that Francis makes an example of is the ‘table of more or less’. Essentially, if we have multiple phenomena that we hypothesize are causally related, we can prove this by tracking them in a table; we increase or decrease the quantum of one phenomena, and see if the other phenomena change in response or not. If they do, the phenomenon are causally related, otherwise they are not. In applying this method, Francis discovers (one of his few specific contributions to science) that heat is a form of motion, as when heat increases the only other phenomenon to increase with exact elasticity is motion. | . | To Francis, like Plato, the forms of the phenomenon he studies are the laws that govern them. They are the foundation of theory and practice; where either is useless without the other. | . 4.4.3 – The Utopia of Science . | Bacon envisioned in the New World, a fertile ground for his Utopian idea of a society arranged on science. ‘New Atlantis’, as he called it, because the Americas were seen as that sunken continent; not sunken, merely undiscovered. | In his work, explorers come upon this lone island of New Atlantis. They happen upon, not savages, but intelligent men. They see not a society of barbarism, but one of intelligent arrangement. Political power over the island rests in ‘Solomon’s House’, a sort of parliament, but without the politicians. The island is administered in a most libertarian way, and efforts are expended more towards conquering nature than man. | These administrators focus on astronomy, medicine, physics, engineering, and other such bland sciences, rather than corrupt politics. The people here have imitated the flight of the birds, and can fly in the air; they have ships that can go underwater. | The people of this island do not busy themselves with war or trade (as Plato or Aristotle, seen as the same thing). They consume only what they produce, and produce only what they consume. Ideas flow into the island not through trade; instead, explorers from the island are sent to every corner of the globe, to observe civilized societies and their innovations in all manners, and return within 12 years with everything documented. | .

    "title": "5 – Spinoza",
    "content": "5.1 – His Life and Times . Spinoza was the child of Sephardim who fled Spain after the Reconquista and the Inquisition. The Jews were still a homeless and persecuted people at the time, and his orgins reflected this. He was born in Amsterdam, in the Dutch Republic; one of the few places to offer refuge to the expelled. As a child, Spinoza was devout. No doubt, as he thought of the trials of tribulations of his ancestors, persecuted and chased around for their faith, his faith only strengthened. His father was a merchant, but he had no such inclination – instead, he spent his time at a synagogue in Amsterdam (known as the Esnoga), the most grandiose in Europe at the time. He was well-educated in the theology and history of his people. He moved quickly from the Bible, to commentaries, and then to prominent Jewish philosophers. But this did not indoctrinate him into religious dogma – instead, as Will notes, clever apologia of religion often provokes as much doubt as it puts down. And so it was for Spinoza who, not satisfied with the thoughts of his people, and examined Christian thought as well. He studied Latin, which opened to him Greek thought. But most pronounced was the influence of Descartes. Descartes was what we would call a ‘rationalist’, one who thought that reason was the best tool to decipher truth and reality. This line of thought is in contrast to Bacon who, as explained before, preferred observation and experience (‘empiricism’). The contest between these two schools took up the minds of the brightest philosophers for generations to come. The logic of rationalism was simple: all humans view the world subjectively, as not all minds think similarly. What we perceive (sensory experience), which is the basis of empiricism, is thus possibly ‘tainted’ and can not be trusted. The mind can only know itself objectively (‘I think, therefore I am’), and thus, only that should be relied upon in philosoophy (the pursuit of truth). But this did not interest Spinoza. He preferred Descartes’ speculations on the nature of reality instead. Descartes thought that all matter was made up of an underlying, abstract, and immaterial substance, and that the same was true of the mind. He also thought that everything obeyed mathematical and/or mechanical rules. Everything everywhere moved according to these rules, but inside the body (where the soul resides), and outside the Universe (the kingdom of God). Spinoza developed on his thoughts in this regard, and for this he was excommunicated. Part of this was because his heresies struck at Judaic orthodoxies, and the other part was because they struck at Christian orthodoxies with equal force. Spinoza, already an alien in an unfamiliar land, was robbed of what little community he had. His father disinherited him, and other tragedies followed. It became intolerable, however, when a fanatic attempted to murder him. He took on an adopted name and isolated himself. He earned little, and carefully accounted for what he spent (living paycheck-to-paycheck, as the kids would say). His living was ascetic, or if you wish to be harsh, slovenly. Spinoza only published two works in his lifetime: ‘The Principles of Cartesian Philosophy’ and ‘A Treatise on Religion and the State’; the reception of the latter, by no means welcoming, likely influenced his decision not to publish his other works. These were posthumously discovered. What little popularity and what few admirers Spinoza had, he usually rejected. Many sought to patronize him, but he rarely accepted their generosity – instead, he was content to live simply. He was influential, however, and not universally disliked or disregarded. It was simply that he did not care much for such things as fame. Spinoza died at 44, in the lodging he had lived in for years now. His sedentary lifestyle no doubt contributed to his sufferings, as he was ill for quite some time till his death. 5.2 – His Works . Spinoza’s ‘Tractatus Theologico-Politicus’ is a scathing critique of religion. The ideas expressed within are common enough to be unoriginal now, but it is no wonder he was so persecuted in his times. He takes particular issue with how religion is crafted for the popular mind; in so doing, scripture employs the human imagination, rather than reason. The near-universal religious emphasis on miracles, individuality, and especially the glorification of a specific people are examples of this. Spinoza does not necessarily take issue with the conception of a God, insofar as he thinks that God and Nature are one. Religion appeals to a human conception of God, with personal attributes (the forgiving, just, e.t.c). In reality, God is a mover, and one who only moves in accordance with his nature, not for some human virtue. Furthermore, Spinoza advocates a sort of Abrahamic unity. He praises Jesus as a paragon of virtue, and his ethics as the most wise of all. In his view, if you were to strip the parables and miracles, Judaism and Christianity are composed of the same ‘core’. In his ‘The Improvement of the Intellect’, Spinoza regales us with the story of why he began his ascetic-esque lifestyle: in his words, ‘experience had taught me that all things which frequently take place in ordinary life are vain and futile’. He elaborates that wants, desires, fears, and joys are only extant so long as the mind allows them to exist. This sort of reflection led him to a conclusion: if he could instead turn his mind to finding pleasure in intellectual enterprise, to the accumulation of wisdom (a pursuit ‘eternal’, as opposed to worldly desire), then he could also be eternally happy. But what is wisdom? How do we seek knowledge? Spinoza addresses this question, first, by categorizing the various forms of knowledge: . | Hear-say knowledge, as in rumours and gossip. | Vague experience, as in intuition. | Immediate deduction, as in phenomenon explained by logic but not empirically proven. | Knowledge deduced and empirically proven, as in the laws of physics. | .

    "content": "The search for millions is usually speculation, not investment, but there is money to be made through discipline and patience. Graham gives us an example of the exaggeration common in marketing investing: in the year 1929, an influential figure named John J. Raskob claimed that investing $15/month in common stocks,1 and reinvesting any dividend,2 would produce $80,000 in 20 years. In reality, you would only earn $8,500. But, compared to a total investment principal of $3,600 (excl. reinvested dividends), this is quite a return–especially when you need only put aside $15/month. It is also a risk-averse strategy–the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined from 177 to 300 in the 20-year period, but you would still make large gains. This is because money was invested per-month, a strategy known as dollar-cost averaging.3 The DJIA didn’t just decline from 300-177 in a straight line, it fluctuated in between, often falling below its actual endpoint of 177. You can see an example in the figure below: the blue plot shows your portfolio worth if you invested $15/month from 1929-1949 in the DJIA, coming to a total principal investment of $2420 and an end portfolio of $4889 for a ROI (return on investment) of 202%; the red plot shows your portfolio worth if you were to invest that $2420 in one go at the start of 1929–an end portfolio of $1404 or a ROI of -58%.

    "content": "An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative. In an investment operation, your principal must be returned, and you should also aquire an adequate amount of return. If you’ve invested $100 in an investment operation, you must have the $100 principal back and a, say, $10 return (if 10% is adequate). Anything else is speculation. Most people associate investment with speculation–especially with day-trading4–which is quite misleading. Investment and speculation should be thoroughly separated, and when investing you must run when you even hear of speculation. That is not to say speculation must be avoided at all costs, because that’s not even possible. There is risk in all investments–the risk for the buyer that the stock may go down, and for the seller that the stock may go up5–and someone must assume that risk. Without speculators, many new companies would never get funds to innovate, as investing in these sorts of companies is a considerable risk. But speculation must, at most, be a pastime, and the bulk of your funds should be in safe investments. Note that margin accounts are also speculation because they are essentially investing beyond your means.6 . 2.1 – For the Defensive Investor . The defensive investor is one interested moreso in safety from risk than in large returns. For these people, Benjamin recommends that they: . | Hold a significant amount of their wealth in bond-type holdings7 and equities. The ratio of bonds:equities should be between 25:75 and 75:25, or you could just do a simple 50:50. | When the market trends up, take your money from equities into bonds, and when the market trends down take your money from bonds into equities. Basically, reallocate the ratio inverse to the movement of the markets. | You can invest in mutual funds8 as a safe and simple alternative to manually managing your own portfolio. | You should utilize dollar-cost averaging as explained earlier. | . 2.2 – For the Aggressive Investor . The aggressive investor is interested in his returns moreso than his safety. For these people, it is recommended they: . | Buy when the market is advancing, and sell when the market is declining. | Put more in stocks than bonds. | Buy short-term, sell short-term. | For long-term investments, buy stocks that have an excellent record of past growth, or are very likely to begin an excellent record of growth. | .

However, high-inflation’s effects are harder to pin down. Are equities good hedges against inflation, and are they – common stocks – better than bonds for this purpose? In times of high inflation, should you reallocate to common stocks thus? As the last point indicates, the market is inherently unpredictable during times of high inflation, thus this assertion is simply false. It is also too simplistic to categorically reject all bonds in favor of stocks. What about other hedges against inflation? Gold offers far too low returns, and is unjustifiable when we consider storage expenses. Other commodities have a similar issue, as well as the speculative nature of investing in them. Real estate is a bit more viable, but is similarly unstable and speculative. It is also considerably more complex to plan than plain commodities (you have to pick location, etc.). REITs9, however, do simplify the process. With all this considered, Benjamin doubles down on his advice in the last chapter–maintain a portfolio balanced between stocks and bonds. ",

Judge by three other factors instead: real growth–the rise in corporate earnings and average yield of dividends per share; inflationary growth–the rise of prices in the economy; and speculative growth–public opinion of the markets.

    "content": "5.1 – On Stocks . Graham argues that passive investors get low-returns–those intelligent investors willing to get their hands dirty will ensure a maximum return, regardless of aggressive or defensive portfolios. It all begins with determining your bond-stock ratio. The most plain configuration would be 50:50 (bonds:stock), with 25:75 or 75:25 if the market is down and the market is up, respectively. This is because you want to buy the lows, sell the highs. But this is an obvious principle–putting it to practice is considerably tougher. Most of the issue is psychological, really, with average investors buying high expecting to cash in on the ride, only realizing afterwards that they were at the peak… what you want to do is be the one selling to them at the peak, and buying it back for cheap once the ride is over. If you don’t have confidence in your decision-making and discipline regarding this, just keep your stock allocation below 50%. If you want to be safer (more defensive, if you will), you can increase in lesser proportions–for example, increasing to 55% stocks when you think the market is down, and 55% bonds when you think it’s up. This buffets your losses somewhat if you make a mistaken judgment. 5.2 – On Bonds . There are really two factors in this: do you want tax-free or taxable bonds, and shorter or longer term maturities? The first is usually an arithmetic issue. Comparing two bonds, say, deduct your taxes from the taxable bond and see the actual returns on the two, then pick. Simple maths. The second is a bit different. In picking bonds, do you want a bond that yields lower annually and does not promise returns on gains that occur but is safer (short-term), or the opposite (long-term)? If interest rates rise, for instance, short-term bonds fall less, but if interest rates fall, they also rise less.

On picking your portfolio, Graham offers the following advice: . | Ensure you are diversified–in between a minimum of 10 stocks and a maximum of 30 | Practice due dilligence on these company picks–ensure they are large and conservatively/prudently financed | Ensure a long dividend payments history–most DJIA companies abide by this, generally, but 10 years should be the minimum | The price you’re willing to pay for a stock should be decided by the average earnings of said stock over the past 10-years–namely, you should not be paying more than 25x these average earnings.

    "content": "The aggressive investor must be willing to leave the safety of high-grade bonds and common stocks. This does not mean investing in inferior types of bonds or preferred stocks, however. The same goes for foreign government bonds, new bonds, and new stocks, or, stocks with good finances but limited only to the near past. With such high yields on even first-rate non-convertible corporate bonds, it makes very little sense to buy junk bonds. There is no need to take the risk, even for the aggressive investor. If high-grade bonds do not yield high enough interest rates, then it may be worth buying heavily discounted junk bonds. These bonds (and preferred stocks) also have the tendency to sink severely during tough markets, only to recover rapidly after everything ‘goes back to normal’–so use that to your advantage, and diversify your risk by buying mutual funds. Foreign government bonds are best avoided. They are not only inherently unstable, but they also require you to be somewhat familiar with the finances and even politics of the foreign government whose bonds you are purchasing. Be cautious with new issues. IPOs are usually offered at discounted rates to attract investors, which adds to the scent of allure–but is all the more reason to be cautious about them. IPOs are also undertaken usually when the market is at a peak–meaning, they’re selling you the stock while it’s going to be valued highest, at least for the near future. And, always remember Graham’s principle that you should only buy a stock if you think it is a cheap way to own a desirable business. ",

    "content": "Graham gives us some simple principles for the dos of aggressive investing. | Buy when cheap, and sell when expensive | Buy growth stocks | After careful evaluation, buy bargain issues | Keep diversified–concentration may make wealth, but it can also kill it | . Graham makes some careful changes to the definition of ‘growth stocks’.10 He argues that growth stocks are not companies positioned to do better in the near future–a growth stock must already have a record of high growth and realistic, founded expectations that it will do as well, or better, in the future. There are some problems with growth stocks. For instance, such stocks are expensive. You wouldn’t be the only one with the idea of purchasing them, after all. Often, these factors are already recognized into the price of the stock–especially when you’re late to the party (look for a PE ratio &lt;25, with earnings being averaged over the past seven years). And, of course, you may turn out to be wrong about company prospects. No one can see into the future, after all. Finally, the more a growth stock has grown, the less room for growth it has left. Thus, it grows more slowly. Growth stocks fluctuate heavily. In fact, they fluctuate so much, based on even small happenings, that they may as well be speculative. Their volatility is almost entirely correlated with their actual growth compared to one wildcard factor: public enthusiasm. If public enthusiasm outgrows actual stock growth, the stock becomes a risky hold. It’s hard to index ‘public enthusiasm’, and thus these stocks become speculative. If there are overvalued growth stocks, then there will also be undervalued growth stocks. Graham calls these the ‘relatively unpopular large company’. These are a large companies going through temporary unpopularity. They must be large, because large companies are more quicker and more likely to respond correctly to the issues that caused their temporary unpopularity. Be careful in picking bargain issues and only purchase them ‘on the basis of facts established by analysis’. Mathematically, Graham defines bargains as having a price worth less than 50% their actual value. ",

    "content": "Investment companies that allow you to redeem your shares at any time are called mutual funds, or open-end funds. Funds that don’t allow you to withdraw at any time are closed-end funds. Funds that hold all-stock portfolios are stock-funds, funds that hold all-bond portfolios are bond funds, and balanced funds usually have 1/3rd or more bonds. Investing in funds offers greater returns and security than common stocks or bonds purchased directly. This is true even if (as they mostly do) funds directly follow the market or the S&amp;P 500. Some general points about funds: . | Invest in funds that spend less on operating costs. The &gt; the fund expenses, the &lt; its returns. | The &gt; the frequency a fund trades its stocks, the &lt; it earns. | Funds with high past returns aren’t likely to remain winners. | Investing in popular funds–popular because they ensured high returns in the near past–is very risky. The companies invested in by that fund get even more overvalued as more and more people put their money into the fund, and run a greater chance of crashing. | Invest in funds with managers who are their own biggest shareholders. This ensures they manage your money like it’s their own (because it is). | Invest in cheaper funds. | Invest in funds that offer something unique. | Invest in funds that close their doors to new investors when they feel their investments are getting too popular–saving them from the consequences of overvaluation and having more money than they know what to do with. | Sell when the fund goes through an unexpected change in strategy, increase in expenses, or ensures a suddenly erratic return (good or bad). | .

    "content": "Security analysis is the examination and evaluation of individual stocks and bonds. Financial analysis is security analysis, general portfolio policy, and general economic analysis, all combined. When dealing with bonds or preferred stocks, check that the ratio of earnings (averaged over the last 7yrs) to total fixed charges is &gt;=5, but this varies sector-to-sector. Ensure that the operation is large, also. Individual forecasts are usually off-the-mark, more often than not, so focus on group forecasts instead. | Common stock is a security that grants you ownership of a certain % of a corporation, corresponding to the amount of shares you own/total shares. &#8617; . | Dividends are a portion of a companies’ revenue given to shareholders. The amount given to a shareholder depends on the number of shares he owns–dividends are yielded per share. Companies that are large, established, and have little room for expansion ususally yield dividends as they can’t invest these profits in R&amp;D or expanding. That is also why startups don’t yield dividends. &#8617; . | Dollar cost averaging is a risk-averse strategy to buying stocks. Instead of purchasing shares at a single price point, you buy in smaller amounts at regular intervals. This prevents you from spending all your money on a stock–only for it to dip right after. Instead, you buy (less) stock at both times. &#8617; . | ‘Day’ trading is so-called because investors buy and sell stock within a trading day. In conventional investing, you buy stock perhaps at once or regular intervals (see: dollar-cost averaging) and abstain from withdrawing for a while. In day-trading, however, you buy and sell extremely often. &#8617; . | If the stock appreciates, the seller loses out because he could’ve sold the stock for more. If the stock depreciates, the buyer loses out because he could’ve bought the stock for less. &#8617; . | Margin is money you borrow to invest on top of a similar amount of money that is actually yours. If you have a certain margin on top of your own money (let’s say $100 both for a total of $200), and the stock you’re investing in goes up 20%, you now have $240. Once you pay back the $100 margin, you have $140 (as opposed to $120 if you didn’t take the margin). The effective gain of 40% is your leverage. But you also stand to lose far more than if you just invested your own money, thus its classification as speculative. &#8617; . | Bond-type holdings–for instance, US treasuries–are securities issued by governments or corporations to fund their obligations and spending. &#8617; . | A mutual fund is a company that pools money from various sources, including common investors, and invests the money for them. &#8617; . | REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are companies that own properties and collect rent from them. &#8617; . | Growth stocks are companies that are increasing their revenue, net income, or net EPS rapidly. &#8617; . | .

Therefore, if you were to simply own the (publicly-held) economy, your investments would multiply pretty easily, year-on-year, with no effort (you don’t need to sell and buy often, like a day trader). To own (part) of the entire public economy, but you can purchase traditional index funds – these funds hold all stocks in a basket and allow you to buy a share of the basket, thus allowing you to buy a part of every public stock/company. Understand compounding. A common story goes: there once was a king who challenged a sage to a match of chess, and offered to the sage that if he won, he could have anything he wanted. The sage’s demand was exceedingly ‘humble’: he wanted 1 grain of rice for the first square of the chessboard, 2 grains for the second, 4 grains for the third, and so on until the 64th square. The king lost, but no sweat, right? Well, 2 doubled to 4, 4 doubled to 8, by the third week the sage received a sack of rice worth of grains, and eventually the king had to sell his whole kingdom to afford the grains! . The brokers always win, so avoid them (and their fees) as best you can by trading less. When a stock you hold gains, you are profiting off someone else’s loss. The people who shorted the stock, the person who sold you your share of the stock, the person who will buy the stock from you in the future, etc. But the broker middle-men who handle all these transactions – who helped you buy the stock in the first place, who helped people short the stock, who (will) help you sell the stock – charge fees, and thus profit regardless of the actual movement of the stock.

Essentially, the stock of a company must track the company’s performance – whether that be its revenue gains, revenue losses, profits, losses, deficits, or whatever else.

The price/earnings (P/E) ratio measures the amount of money investors are willing to put into a company, divided by the amount of money the company is earning. When P/E multiples are high, the stock is overvalued – often because of investor greed. When P/E multiples are low, the stock is undervalued – because of investor fear. Understand regression-to-the-mean (RTM). The stock market follows a bullish trend upwards, year-on-year. There are, however, exceptionally bad years, and exceptionally good years. Understand that these are exceptions to the rule, and the market will regress to the mean soon after – meaning, everything will go back to normal. Do not judge the market on these exceptions. Do not predict the future based solely on the past – predict the future based on lessons from the past, and the reality of the present. This is a point that Benjamin Graham also makes in his books.
