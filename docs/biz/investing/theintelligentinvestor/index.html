aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 1 – Introduction</h2><p>The search for millions is usually <em>speculation</em>, not investment, but there <em>is</em> money to be made through discipline and patience. Graham gives us an example of the exaggeration common in marketing investing: in the year 1929, an influential figure named John J. Raskob claimed that investing $15/month in common stocks,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and reinvesting any dividend,<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> would produce $80,000 in 20 years. In <em>reality</em>, you would only earn $8,500. But, compared to a total investment principal of $3,600 (excl. reinvested dividends), this is <em>quite</em> a return–especially when you need only put aside $15/month.</p><p>It is also a <em>risk-averse</em> strategy–the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined from 177 to 300 in the 20-year period, but you would <em>still</em> make large gains. This is because money was invested per-month, a strategy known as <em>dollar-cost averaging</em>.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> The DJIA didn’t just decline from 300-177 in a straight line, it fluctuated in between, often falling below its actual endpoint of 177.</p><p>You can see an example in the figure below: the blue plot shows your portfolio worth if you invested $15/month from 1929-1949 in the DJIA, coming to a total principal investment of $2420 and an end portfolio of $4889 for a ROI (return on investment) of 202%; the red plot shows your portfolio worth if you were to invest that $2420 in one go at the start of 1929–an end portfolio of $1404 or a ROI of -58%.</p><iframe width="788" height="371" seamless="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQxgEQwle755UPcpuSUKdGCMSIcXA6t81Rh4VzHffpqLPLk4o5uQFdnL9del574OBZXygxi6hgO7G5t/pubchart?oid=1001009403&amp;format=interactive"> </iframe> <iframe width="788" height="371" seamless="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQxgEQwle755UPcpuSUKdGCMSIcXA6t81Rh4VzHffpqLPLk4o5uQFdnL9del574OBZXygxi6hgO7G5t/pubchart?oid=1228419495&amp;format=interactive"> </iframe><h2 id="2--investment-vs-speculation"> <a href="#2--investment-vs-speculation" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="2--investment-vs-speculation"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 2 – Investment vs. Speculation</h2><blockquote><p>An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal <em>and</em> an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.</p></blockquote><p>In an <em>investment</em> operation, your principal <em>must</em> be returned, and you should <em>also</em> aquire an adequate amount of return. If you’ve invested $100 in an investment operation, you <em>must</em> have the $100 principal back <em>and</em> a, say, $10 return (if 10% is adequate). <em>Anything</em> else is speculation. Most people associate investment with speculation–especially with day-trading<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>–which is quite misleading. Investment and speculation should be thoroughly separated, and <em>when</em> investing you must run when you even hear of speculation.</p><p>That is not to say speculation must be avoided at <em>all</em> costs, because that’s not even possible. There is risk in all investments–the risk for the buyer that the stock may go down, and for the seller that the stock may go up<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>–and someone <em>must</em> assume that risk. Without speculators, many new companies would never get funds to innovate, as investing in these sorts of companies is a considerable risk. But speculation must, at most, be a pastime, and the bulk of your funds should be in safe investments. Note that margin accounts are <em>also</em> speculation because they are essentially investing <em>beyond</em> your means.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p><h3 id="21--for-the-defensive-investor"> <a href="#21--for-the-defensive-investor" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="21--for-the-defensive-investor"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 2.1 – For the Defensive Investor</h3><p>The defensive investor is one interested moreso in <em>safety</em> from risk than in large returns. For these people, Benjamin recommends that they:</p><ol><li>Hold a significant amount of their wealth in bond-type holdings<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> and equities. The ratio of bonds:equities should be between 25:75 and 75:25, or you could just do a simple 50:50.<li>When the market trends up, take your money from equities into <em>bonds</em>, and when the market trends down take your money from bonds into <em>equities</em>. Basically, reallocate the ratio <em>inverse</em> to the movement of the markets.<li>You can invest in mutual funds<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> as a safe and simple alternative to manually managing your own portfolio.<li>You <em>should</em> utilize dollar-cost averaging as explained earlier.</ol><h3 id="22--for-the-aggressive-investor"> <a href="#22--for-the-aggressive-investor" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="22--for-the-aggressive-investor"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 2.2 – For the Aggressive Investor</h3><p>The aggressive investor is interested in his <em>returns</em> moreso than his safety. For these people, it is recommended they:</p><ol><li>Buy when the market is advancing, and sell when the market is declining.<li>Put more in stocks than bonds.<li>Buy short-term, sell short-term.<li>For long-term investments, buy stocks that have an excellent record of past growth, or are very likely to <em>begin</em> an excellent record of growth.</ol><h2 id="3--the-investor-and-inflation"> <a href="#3--the-investor-and-inflation" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="3--the-investor-and-inflation"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 3 – The Investor and Inflation</h2><p><strong>Does inflation affect market movement?</strong> The record is mixed–deflation affects the stock market negatively, and regular inflation usually indicates a growing stock market. However, high-inflation’s effects are harder to pin down.</p><p><strong>Are equities good hedges against inflation, and are they – common stocks – better than bonds for this purpose?</strong> In times of high inflation, should you reallocate to common stocks thus? As the last point indicates, the market is <em>inherently</em> unpredictable during times of high inflation, thus this assertion is simply false. It is also too simplistic to categorically reject all bonds in favor of stocks.</p><p><strong>What about other hedges against inflation?</strong> Gold offers far too low returns, and is unjustifiable when we consider storage expenses. Other commodities have a similar issue, as well as the speculative nature of investing in them. Real estate is a bit more viable, but is similarly unstable and speculative. It is also considerably more complex to plan than plain commodities (you have to pick location, etc.). REITs<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>, however, do simplify the process.</p><p>With all this considered, Benjamin doubles down on his advice in the last chapter–<strong>maintain a portfolio balanced between stocks and bonds.</strong></p><h2 id="4--stock-market-history"> <a href="#4--stock-market-history" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="4--stock-market-history"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 4 – Stock-Market History</h2><p>For judging the <em>whole</em> stock market – the institution – as one, an understanding of stock-market history is necessary. However, one <em>must not</em> forecast the future through his understanding of the past alone. <em>Never</em> assume the market will continue to grow because it has been growing for the past few years, or vice versa.</p><p>Judge by three other factors instead: real growth–the rise in corporate earnings and average yield of dividends per share; inflationary growth–the rise of prices in the economy; and speculative growth–public opinion of the markets. A simple calculation of expected stock market growth (after inflation) is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yearly growth in corporate earnings + avg dividend yield</code>. Speculative growth is a factor when the public’s greed drives the market up–but only temporarily, precipitating a dramatic crash.</p><h2 id="5--for-the-defensive-investor-expanded"> <a href="#5--for-the-defensive-investor-expanded" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="5--for-the-defensive-investor-expanded"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 5 – For the Defensive Investor: Expanded</h2><h3 id="51--on-stocks"> <a href="#51--on-stocks" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="51--on-stocks"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 5.1 – On Stocks</h3><p>Graham argues that <em>passive</em> investors get low-returns–those intelligent investors willing to get their hands dirty will ensure a maximum return, regardless of aggressive or defensive portfolios.</p><p>It all begins with determining your <em>bond-stock ratio</em>. The most plain configuration would be 50:50 (bonds:stock), with 25:75 or 75:25 if the market is down and the market is up, respectively.</p><p>This is because you want to buy the lows, sell the highs. But this is an obvious principle–putting it to practice is considerably tougher. Most of the issue is psychological, really, with average investors buying high expecting to cash in on the ride, only realizing afterwards that they were at the peak… what <em>you</em> want to do is be the one selling to them at the peak, and buying it back for cheap once the ride is over.</p><p>If you don’t have confidence in your decision-making and discipline regarding this, just keep your <em>stock allocation</em> below 50%. If you want to be safer (more defensive, if you will), you can increase in lesser proportions–for example, increasing to 55% stocks when you think the market is down, and 55% bonds when you think it’s up. This buffets your losses somewhat if you make a mistaken judgment.</p><h3 id="52--on-bonds"> <a href="#52--on-bonds" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="52--on-bonds"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 5.2 – On Bonds</h3><p>There are really two factors in this: do you want tax-free or taxable bonds, and shorter or longer term maturities? The first is usually an arithmetic issue. Comparing two bonds, say, deduct your taxes from the taxable bond and see the actual returns on the two, then pick. Simple maths.</p><p>The second is a bit different. In picking bonds, do you want a bond that yields lower annually and does not promise returns on gains that occur but is safer (short-term), or the opposite (long-term)? If interest rates rise, for instance, short-term bonds fall less, but if interest rates fall, they also rise less. Medium-term bonds are usually the best choice, if you don’t want to put too much thought into it.</p><p>Another factor might be: do you need investments to <em>supplement</em> your actual income/month? In that case, invest more on short-term bonds.</p><h2 id="6--on-common-stonks"> <a href="#6--on-common-stonks" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="6--on-common-stonks"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 6 – On Common Stonks</h2><p>Common stocks offer greater returns (incl. dividends) than bonds, usually, and thus function as somewhat better hedges against inflation. Even in the <em>worst</em> of conditions, a common-stock portfolio alongside your bonds would be better than an all-bond holding.</p><p>On picking your portfolio, Graham offers the following advice:</p><ol><li>Ensure you are diversified–in between a minimum of 10 stocks and a maximum of 30<li>Practice due dilligence on these company picks–ensure they are large and conservatively/prudently financed<li>Ensure a long dividend payments history–most DJIA companies abide by this, generally, but 10 years should be the minimum<li>The price you’re willing to pay for a stock should be decided by the average earnings of said stock over the past 10-years–namely, you should not be paying more than 25x these average earnings. Basically, if the P/E ratio of a company–where the E is its earnings averaged over the last 10 years–is &gt;25, do not buy!</ol><p><strong>Practice dollar-cost averaging!</strong></p><h2 id="7--what-you-shouldnt-do-for-the-aggressive-investor-expanded"> <a href="#7--what-you-shouldnt-do-for-the-aggressive-investor-expanded" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="7--what-you-shouldnt-do-for-the-aggressive-investor-expanded"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 7 – What You Shouldn’t Do: For the Aggressive Investor: Expanded</h2><p>The aggressive investor must be willing to leave the safety of high-grade bonds and common stocks. This does <em>not</em> mean investing in inferior types of bonds or preferred stocks, however. The same goes for foreign government bonds, new bonds, and new stocks, or, stocks with good finances but limited only to the near past.</p><p>With such high yields on even first-rate non-convertible corporate bonds, it makes <em>very little</em> sense to buy junk bonds. There is no need to take the risk, even for the aggressive investor. If high-grade bonds do not yield high enough interest rates, then it <em>may</em> be worth buying <em>heavily</em> discounted junk bonds. These bonds (and preferred stocks) also have the tendency to sink <em>severely</em> during tough markets, only to recover rapidly after everything ‘goes back to normal’–so use that to your advantage, and diversify your risk by buying mutual funds.</p><p>Foreign government bonds are best avoided. They are not only inherently unstable, but they also require you to be somewhat familiar with the finances and even politics of the foreign government whose bonds you are purchasing.</p><p>Be <em>cautious</em> with new issues. IPOs are usually offered at discounted rates to attract investors, which adds to the scent of allure–but is all the more reason to be cautious about them. IPOs are also undertaken usually when the market is at a peak–meaning, they’re selling you the stock while it’s going to be valued highest, at least for the near future. And, always remember Graham’s principle that you should <em>only</em> buy a stock if you think it is a cheap way to own a <em>desirable</em> business.</p><h2 id="8--what-you-should-do-for-the-aggressive-investor-expanded"> <a href="#8--what-you-should-do-for-the-aggressive-investor-expanded" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="8--what-you-should-do-for-the-aggressive-investor-expanded"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 8 – What You Should Do: For the Aggressive Investor: Expanded</h2><p>Graham gives us some simple principles for the dos of aggressive investing.</p><ol><li>Buy when cheap, and sell when expensive<li>Buy growth stocks<li>After careful evaluation, buy bargain issues<li>Keep diversified–concentration may make wealth, but it can also kill it</ol><p>Graham makes some careful changes to the definition of ‘growth stocks’.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> He argues that growth stocks are not companies <em>positioned</em> to do better in the near future–a growth stock must <em>already</em> have a record of high growth and realistic, founded expectations that it will do as well, or better, in the future.</p><p>There <em>are</em> some problems with growth stocks. For instance, such stocks are expensive. You wouldn’t be the only one with the idea of purchasing them, after all. Often, these factors are already recognized into the price of the stock–especially when you’re late to the party (look for a PE ratio &lt;25, with earnings being averaged over the past seven years). And, of course, you may turn out to be wrong about company prospects. No one can see into the future, after all. Finally, the more a growth stock has grown, the less room for growth it has left. Thus, it grows more slowly.</p><p>Growth stocks fluctuate <em>heavily</em>. In fact, they fluctuate so much, based on even small happenings, that they may as well be speculative. Their volatility is almost entirely correlated with their actual growth compared to one wildcard factor: public enthusiasm. If public enthusiasm outgrows actual stock growth, the stock becomes a risky hold. It’s hard to index ‘public enthusiasm’, and thus these stocks become speculative.</p><p>If there are overvalued growth stocks, then there will <em>also</em> be undervalued growth stocks. Graham calls these the ‘relatively unpopular large company’. These are a <em>large</em> companies going through <em>temporary</em> unpopularity. They <em>must</em> be large, because large companies are more quicker and more likely to respond correctly to the issues that caused their temporary unpopularity.</p><p>Be careful in picking bargain issues and only purchase them ‘on the basis of facts established by analysis’. Mathematically, Graham defines bargains as having a price worth less than 50% their actual value.</p><h2 id="9--investing-in-investment-funds"> <a href="#9--investing-in-investment-funds" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="9--investing-in-investment-funds"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 9 – Investing in Investment Funds</h2><p>Investment companies that allow you to redeem your shares at any time are called mutual funds, or open-end funds. Funds that <em>don’t</em> allow you to withdraw at any time are closed-end funds.</p><p>Funds that hold all-stock portfolios are stock-funds, funds that hold all-bond portfolios are bond funds, and balanced funds usually have 1/3rd or more bonds.</p><p>Investing in funds offers greater returns <em>and</em> security than common stocks or bonds purchased directly. This is true even if (as they mostly do) funds directly follow the market or the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Some general points about funds:</p><ol><li>Invest in funds that spend less on operating costs. The &gt; the fund expenses, the &lt; its returns.<li>The &gt; the frequency a fund trades its stocks, the &lt; it earns.<li>Funds with high past returns aren’t likely to remain winners.<li>Investing in popular funds–popular because they ensured high returns in the near past–is very risky. The companies invested in by that fund get even more overvalued as more and more people put their money into the fund, and run a greater chance of crashing.<li>Invest in funds with managers who are their own biggest shareholders. This ensures they manage your money like it’s their own (because it is).<li>Invest in cheaper funds.<li>Invest in funds that offer something unique.<li>Invest in funds that close their doors to new investors when they feel their investments are getting too popular–saving them from the consequences of overvaluation and having more money than they know what to do with.<li>Sell when the fund goes through an unexpected change in strategy, increase in expenses, or ensures a suddenly erratic return (good or bad).</ol><h2 id="10--the-investor-and-his-advisers"> <a href="#10--the-investor-and-his-advisers" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="10--the-investor-and-his-advisers"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 10 – The Investor and His Advisers</h2><p>When basing your investments on advice from anyone – be it relatives or your broker – ensure that the advice is realistic, unimaginative, and conservative. If not, don’t practice it, unless you trust the advisor <em>extremely</em> well.</p><p>Investment advisors who charge for services are almost always practical and realistic, and don’t promise anything big. Keep this standard for everyone Again, louder for the people in the back, <strong>THERE IS NO EASY PATH TO WEALTH</strong>! Anyone selling you this is a fraud, otherwise he would be profiting from it <em>alone</em>.</p><p>Brokerage reputation varies depending on the place where you’re investing, but they are a good choice to go to for advice. You probably need advice, investing or general financial, if you have:</p><ol><li>Horrible budgeting skills – you’re living paycheck-to-paycheck, or even worse, you fail to pay your bills on time regularly<li>Big losses on your investments–but only if they’re worse than the stock markets returns over the same (large) period of time<li>If your life is changing dramatically, and you need to reorient your finances, help is always nice.</ol><h2 id="11--security-analysis-for-the-lay-investor"> <a href="#11--security-analysis-for-the-lay-investor" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="11--security-analysis-for-the-lay-investor"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> 11 – Security Analysis for the Lay Investor</h2><p>Security analysis is the examination and evaluation of individual stocks and bonds. <em>Financial</em> analysis is security analysis, general portfolio policy, and general economic analysis, <em>all</em> combined.</p><p>When dealing with bonds or preferred stocks, check that the ratio of earnings (averaged over the last 7yrs) to total fixed charges is &gt;=5, but this varies sector-to-sector.

The amount given to a shareholder depends on the number of shares he owns–dividends are yielded per share. Companies that are large, established, and have little room for expansion ususally yield dividends as they can’t invest these profits in R&amp;D or expanding. That is also why startups <em>don’t</em> yield dividends. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p><li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote"><p>Dollar cost averaging is a risk-averse strategy to buying stocks. Instead of purchasing shares at a single price point, you buy in smaller amounts at regular intervals. This prevents you from spending all your money on a stock–only for it to dip right after. Instead, you buy (less) stock at both times. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p><li id="fn:4" role="doc-endnote"><p>‘Day’ trading is so-called because investors buy <em>and</em> sell stock within a trading day. In conventional investing, you buy stock perhaps at once or regular intervals (see: dollar-cost averaging) and abstain from withdrawing for a while. In day-trading, however, you buy and sell extremely often. <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p><li id="fn:5" role="doc-endnote"><p>If the stock appreciates, the seller loses out because he could’ve sold the stock for more.

If you have a certain margin on top of your <em>own</em> money (let’s say $100 both for a total of $200), and the stock you’re investing in goes up 20%, you now have $240. Once you pay back the $100 margin, you have $140 (as opposed to $120 if you didn’t take the margin). The effective gain of 40% is your <em>leverage</em>.
