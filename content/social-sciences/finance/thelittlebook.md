## The Little Book of Common-Sense Investing

_by John C. Bogle_

{{< toc >}}

### 0 --- Introduction

**Investing is a common-sense game, and common-sense suggests that _'simple is best'_.** For instance, evidence plainly proves that the economy, and thus the stock market, _always_ grows in the long-run. Therefore, if you were to simply own the (publicly-held) stock-market, your investments would multiply, year-on-year, with no effort (you don't need to sell and buy often, like a day trader). To own (part) of the entire public economy, you can purchase _traditional index funds_ --- these funds hold a bunch of stocks in a basket and allow you to buy a share of the basket, thus allowing you to buy a part of every public stock/company.

**Understand compounding.** A common story goes: there once was a king who challenged a sage to a match of chess, and offered to the sage that if he won, he could have anything he wanted. The sage's demand was exceedingly 'humble': he wanted 1 grain of rice for the first square of the chessboard, 2 grains for the second, 4 grains for the third, and so on until the 64th square. The king lost, but no sweat, right? Well, 2 doubled to 4, 4 doubled to 8, by the third week the sage received a sack of rice worth of grains, and eventually the king had to sell his whole kingdom to afford the grains!

**The brokers always win, so avoid them (and their fees) as best you can by trading less.** When a stock you hold gains, you are profiting off _someone else's_ loss. The people who shorted the stock, the person who sold you _your_ share of the stock, the person who will buy the stock from you in the future, etc. But the broker middle-men who handle _all_ these transactions -- who helped you buy the stock in the first place, who helped people short the stock, who (will) help you sell the stock -- charge fees, and thus profit regardless of the actual movement of the stock.

### 1 --- A Parable

**For investors, returns decrease as motion increases.** Let's say you have $10,000 to invest and you put it into a bunch of stocks. Let's also say you frequently pull out of and into these (and other) stocks. You secure a 10% return annually, which seems pretty nice. But you might _still_ be earning less than the person who put all his money into a few funds and secures a 7% return annually. Why? Because he has to pay less fees to brokers and analysts! In the long term, his strategy is also far more reliable and predictable than the person playing cat and mouse.

**For Wall Street, the more you move your money around (through their services), the more money they make.** Therefore, it's in the best interests of Wall Street (or any other market, really) to keep you moving your money constantly --- even if this is the exact _opposite_ of a sound investment strategy.

### 2 --- Rational Exuberance

**"Over time, the aggregate gains made by ... shareholders must of necessity match the business gains of the company".** Essentially, the stock of a company must track the company's performance --- whether that be its revenue gains, revenue losses, profits, losses, deficits, or whatever else. If it does _not_, then something fishy and common shareholders are set to suffer.

**The price/earnings (P/E) ratio measures the amount of money investors are willing to put into a company, divided by the amount of money the company is earning.** When P/E multiples are high, the stock is overvalued --- often because of investor greed. When P/E multiples are low, the stock is undervalued --- because of investor fear.

**Understand regression-to-the-mean (RTM).** The stock market follows a bullish trend upwards, year-on-year. There are, however, exceptionally bad years, and exceptionally good years. Understand that these are _exceptions_ to the rule, and the market will regress to the mean soon after --- meaning, everything will go back to normal. Do not judge the market _on_ these exceptions.

**Do not predict the future based solely on the past --- predict the future based on _lessons_ from the past, and the reality of the present.** Essentially, if a stock has been performing well for the past few years, that does _not_ mean it will continue to do well in the future. You should only think that if you have an actual justification for why it _might_ continue to do well.

### 3 --- Cast Your Lot with Business

**When you invest in the entire stock market, you are investing in both the profits and losses of other investors.** However, as the history of the market indicates, you almost always make a profit. Therefore, while you might miss the wins of 1% of investors who made profits, you will miss the losses of all the losers and outperform a good chunk of even the profiteers, even when you're eating from their hands!

**Actively managed funds underperform benchmark indexes.** This is a statistically proven fact. Funds come and go, but benchmark indices have stayed --- for a good reason.

### 4 --- How Most Investors Turn a Winners Game into a Losers Game

**Before the costs of brokers, beating the market is a zero-sum game. After costs, it is a loserâ€™s game.** The reason your earnings do not track the performance of your holdings is simple: fees! The costs of investing can turn even winning returns measly --- and make losing returns more expensive! Moving money around the stock market is expensive, whether your money is in a fund or with an investment 'professional'. This is basic arithmetic.

Do not underestimate these costs either --- even a 2% reduction in returns could halve your non-cost returns. Not only should you understand positive compounding, you should also understand *negative* compounding, as in this case.
